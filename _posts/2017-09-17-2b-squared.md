The story for this shoot is amusing. This was supposed to be a shoot between my two friends Woozica and Tomukun and a new friend of ours lipstickgiraffe. Well, if anyone tries to tell you Nier Automata isn't popular, they're dead wrong. We ended up with a full photo shoot of Nier cosplayers and the small shoot turned into a big old group shoot. XD

I didn't really get to talk to anyone while I was shooting away, but I'm so glad to have met all of you and I hope I can meet you again soon! And if I've somehow missed anyone, let me know!
