excerpt: Things worth a double check on your camera before shooting.
---

These are some things you should check before doing type of photography X or Y. Per the norm, I mostly overthink cosplay photography like this.

## General

* Keep an eye on exposure adjustments. You don't want to be stopped down a stop and a half in a dark room.

## Cosplay

* LCD Screens lie. They lie so much.

* Turn off continuous shutter. Maybe it's me, maybe it's my camera, but I find I get blurry shots when I use continuous for shooting mostly static scenes.
