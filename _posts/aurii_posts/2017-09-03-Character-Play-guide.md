# Rules

## Narrative Truth

> Within the imagined world of your shared narrative, everything the players describe happens exactly how they describe it , when they describe it. This is called "the Principle of Narrative Truth" and itâ€™s the nitrous that makes Wushu fast and furious. Actions should always be phrased in the present tense: "I kick him," "I fly over that," "They crash through the wall like wrecking balls." No need to wait for the dice to tell you what happens.

(Keep in mind Wushu is written with the idea of kung fu movies. Some of the phrasing in the book is flavored with that.) Some other things of note about writing for the game:

* Don't be a [Mary Sue](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue). It's okay to lose. It's okay to do poorly. Flaws make better characters than skills do. 
* Don't avoid the problem, solve the problem. If you need to land a crashing plane, flying away with a jet pack does not solve the problem. Getting into the cockpit and trying to land it despite the busted controls is solving the problem.
* Something I want to emphasize. Much like in reality, if you don't show an interest in other people you won't get any interest your way. Take an interest in working with the other characters in the game and you'll have much more fun playing. 
* When in doubt about a scene your character is in: A scene should show something. There's no scene in a book or movie that doesn't either reveal something about a character, advance the storyline, hint at something later, create a new bond between characters, etc.

## Conflict Resolution 

When you need to do something in Wushu, and there's an *obstacle* in your way, you have to score a number of hits against the obstacle. The Gamemaster will assign that number, which is nicknamed the *threat level*. You score hits by doing the following. 

> **You don't have to roll for an action if there's no opposition to you doing it.** If you want to walk down the street, read a book, learn a new skill, eat a cheeseburger, you can. Unless something or someone is actively preventing you from doing it (trying to get through a *locked* door, fighting a person) you don't need a die roll. Play by posts are bogged down by dice rolls, and even at that every Dm's Guide from D&D to Wushu itself will tell you only roll dice when necessary.

1. Narrate what you're doing. The more details, the better!
2. For every detail in your action, the gamemaster will reward you with a die. You'll be given a number of dice to roll. (The maximum for this pool of dice is consistent for everyone in the conflict.)
3. The gamemaster will tell you what your *relevant aspect* is. This is the aspect on your character sheet that most relates to what you're doing. Your *target number* is the number related to that aspect.
4. Decide how many dice that, if rolled as hits, will reduce the *threat level* (attack dice) and how many dice will protect you from damage (defense dice). 
5. Roll all the attack dice and then all the defense dice. For every die that comes out **less than or equal to** your *target number*, you succeed. Every success on an attack die reduces the threat level by one, every success on a defense die prevents on damage done to you. 

How this is going to work in post format:

1. You'll write up a post covering part number 1 above.
2. I'll read your post, and *discord react* the number of dice you'll get for your post. 
3. You'll *edit your post* and add to the bottom "Attack: X, Defense: Y" where X and Y are how many of your pool you are putting into each group. 
4. I'll post with the results of your rolls and the NPCs reactions to your actions. 
  > For the sake of speed, I'm following a recommendation in Wushu's book to roll the dice for the players in a play by post environment. I'll be using the dice roller bot and you'll be able to see the rolls in the dice channel. 

5. Rinse and Repeat.

## NPCs

You are allowed to introduce a new NPC to scene, if that NPC makes sense to be there. Don't put the pope in the sewers, but a priest being in a church makes sense. This NPC can't give you plot relevant information, but can hold a short conversation with your character. If you want to buy beer from the bar for example, the GM doesn't need to write in the innkeeper for that. You can also introduce the character as someone your about to talk to, with an opening line or wave or the like. If you do that, the DM can take over the character you popped into the scene. 

The only exception to using NPCs is ones that the GM is *voicing*, or controlling in the scene. GM controlled NPCs can't be controlled, even for minor things. An NPC currently being 'controlled' or that was introduced into the scene before by another player can be interacted with; but don't take the NPC from that player without shooting them a message asking first. 

## Damage 

At the start of a fight, every player character receives 3 hit points. You aren't defeated until you can't lose anymore hit points. (Till you take damage at 0 hit points.) Every round the threat you're fighting deals *one automatic hit* to every player. If you rolled defense dice, any successes you rolled with them are used before your hit points. 

Enemies that are more than just mooks have their own hit points and rather than a single automatic hit they get to roll their own attack and defense dice. You'll be informed when a *Nemesis* appears in a scene.  

## Side Goals

Often you will do something in a turn that is unrelated to defeating the threat or objective of the action. These side goals in the scenario also have a threat number to be defeated. The only difference is that a side goal does not get an automatic hit against the players. These side goals do not have to be completed, though it's almost always in your benefit to complete them. 

### Walkthrough of Play

A scene will start with a post looking like this:

![](https://i.imgur.com/vwWfQEQ.png)

While the NPC section may be skipped if there are no NPCs, the other sections are always going to be there to give you a reference point. That said, this block represents the **start** of the scene. If an NPC or character enters the scene later, that's not going to be reflected in the above post. 

Following the scene setting post, the GM will have an opening post for the round. To continue off the scene set above, we have this post:

![](https://i.imgur.com/hfhClrV.png)

Once the GM has started the round, each player gets to post once. (For the sake of brevity only Alice and Bob will have posts in the example.)

![](https://i.imgur.com/JOsoxhW.png)

![](https://i.imgur.com/znLcVNz.png)

Alice's post is fairly standard. It describes her thoughts and and actions. Bob's is a little more complicated. When you want to ask a handful of quick questions to an NPC (The kind that have quick responses) you can put a list of questions in a *quote block* like below. (Note those are the **backtick** symbol, located on the same key as **~**.) If you only have one question, you don't have to do this whole thing. The goal is to do a few rounds of question, answer; question, answer; all at once. If you'd like to have a more in depth, personal conversation, you can start an Aside, detailed in the next section.

<pre>
```
1.
2.
```
</pre>

When the time on the round has expired, the GM will post again, responding to what everyone's doing in the scene.

![](https://i.imgur.com/PIPhmEZ.png)

In this post you can see the response to Bob's questions are numbered. However rather than dig into more conversation, some action is afoot! Alice and Bob could certainly leave Larry to his fate, but what self respecting hero would do that? (We're skipping Bob too now, because we're trying to keep the example short.)

![](https://i.imgur.com/zlCnTbB.png)

### Conflict

Well Alice's actions certainly didn't make her any fans. The third round has started a *conflict* which needs to be resolved (which is started by the third post above). The **entire conflict** has a score of 6. Any action taken to resolving the conflict that succeeds will reduce this number. This doesn't mean you have to knock out 6 ruffians. Be creative! 

![](https://i.imgur.com/sFzoJ6y.png)

Alice is decidedly not creative. Take note here, as the GM it was never said the door was left open. If you need a detail to add to how you made your action, add it! As long as it doesn't conflict with something someone else said that's okay. Now not pictured, the GM will react to your post with a number. This number will be up to the *dice pool* number on the conflict and is awarded based on the details in your post. The more dice you have, the more dice you dedicate to either trying to reduce the threat number or protect yourself.

When you try to reduce the threat number, the GM will decide what the most relevant trait you have to the action you're doing is. The GM will roll as many dice as you dedicated to reducing it and for every die that comes up **under** your trait **number** you reduce the threat by one. 

When you protect yourself, you use the **same** trait as the one used with reducing rolls. For every die rolled under the trait number you prevent one hit against you. There is **one automatic hit** against you by the threat itself every round. If there's an enemy character that's rolling dice, they can score hits against you the same way you can against them. You have three hit points (though you aren't out till you hit negative!). Those hit points reset every encounter.

For the above example, The GM awards Alice 3 dice. Alice's player adds the bottom of the post `Attack: 2, Defense: 1`. The GM, before the next round, will roll the dice in the dice channel for Alice's attacks and defense against her most relevant trait. If Alice doesn't roll for her one defense, she gets hit once. For every hit she gets on her attacks, she reduces the threat number. At this point the rounds loop until the threat or players have no level/hp left. The winner gets to narrate their victory and regular rounds resume.

# The Gameplay Areas

## IC (In Character)

These channels are the primary gameplay areas. They can be compared to the table everyone would be sitting around in person. These channels, at least in the beginning, will be dedicated to the *group* events. Everyone in one of the parties will be involved in the events in these channels. There are multiple channels available because it's not expected all of you will be in a massive group all the time. Smaller parties may form and do different things at the same time, and that will branch into two different channels in this section. 

## Asides

If the IC channels can be summed up as *posting*, the asides channels can be summed up as *chatting.* In posting, there's a rotation to it; GM, players, Gm, players. Chatting is being able to immediately go back and forth with the other participant. 

If you decide your character would like to have a conversation with another character in the party privately, the asides are the place to do it. Same goes if you'd like to grill an npc you met. An aside is characterized by a conversation out of the usual game flow. An aside takes place mid another scene, and which scene it takes place in will be marked down. This does mean you can't go across town for your asides, but where ever you are you can certainly step around the corner or into another room to have a chat. Asides are **not** for things that change the scene, moving your characters away from what they're taking an aside from. They should not be used for a 'multipart' scene either; the aside should happen and then end.

### Do's and Don'ts

* Do have an aside when you want to converse with another character in the scene at length.
* Don't have an aside when you want to ditch the group for awhile. (This is splitting the party, you'd likely end up on a second IC channel.)
* Do have an aside when you want to add a scene to a time skip such as 'you travel the rest of the day and eventually make camp'. (you could have a conversation on the trail, in camp, etc.)
* Don't try to advance the IC channel's events from the aside. You may have decided to steal from Bob in your aside, but you have to *do* the stealing in the IC channel.
* Do message the GM if you need dice rolled for anything. 
* Don't have your aside somewhere completely unrelated to the IC channel you asided from. (You were in a general store, your aside shouldn't take place in the woods.)
* Do your asides quickly, the faster they're done the faster the channel can be used for a new one.

### Start and Formatting

The ideal way to start is to contact the other party out of character and setup a time you both can have the aside. (You are not obligated to do a suggested aside.) Let the GM know which channel you'll be taking, sign on together, and type away! If you find it's going longer than you expected that's okay, just be proactive about finishing the aside sooner rather than later. (Orphaned asides can and will be ended prematurely.) This is the same for both NPCs and other players. 

Formatting wise, there should be an opening post which can be pinned to the top of the channel looking like the below. Fill in your information and post that before you start. This should be reminiscent of the way scene's change in the IC channels.

```
Location: <location>
Coming from: <the location you were at before you asided>
Characters: <list of characters>
```

# Character Generation

## Aspects

Aspects are defined in the *Fate Core* book as

> Aspects are phrases that describe some significant detail about a character. They are the reasons why your character matters, why weâ€™re interested in seeing your character in the game. Aspects can cover a wide range of elements, such as personality or descriptive traits, beliefs, relationships, issues and problems, or anything else that helps us invest in the character as a person, rather than just a collection of stats. 

Aspects are short phrases that sum up an *aspect* of your character's personality. In Wushu, almost the exact same thing is referred to as a trait. If you aren't good at witty phrases, that's okay. *Fate* has a few tips for that. 

> If youâ€™re struggling to make an aspect, write out the idea in as many words as you need to, in order to get it down on paper in the first place. If a specific phrase pops up after you write it down, great! If not, maybe someone else at the table can help you come up with an aspect. And if youâ€™re still stuck, leave it for now; youâ€™ll have plenty of time during play to refine it.

Paraphrasing a longer section on aspects, the best aspects have three parts. 

1. Aspects should be **double edged**; which means it can be both a good thing and a bad thing. *Super Nerd* can mean your smart, but it can also mean you're an easy target for bullying. 
2. Aspects should **say more than one thing**; or the aspect describes more than thing about your character. *I want to prove myself* says one thing about the character, *I want to prove myself to my lawyer father* says more than one thing. 
3. Aspects should **keep it simple**; *Child blessed with Pastoral Bliss* may sound catchy, but it's harder to relate to what's going on in the game. *Son of an expert farmer* says the same thing but is far clearer. 

> Here are some guidelines for choosing aspects. Aspects which donâ€™t help you tell a good story (by giving you success when you need it and by drawing you into danger and action when the story needs it) arenâ€™t doing their job. The aspects which push you into conflict, and help you excel once youâ€™re there, will be among your best and most-used. Aspects need to be both useful and dangerous; allowing you to help shape the story and generating lots of fate points and they should never be boring. The best aspect suggests both ways to use it and ways it can complicate your situation. Aspects that cannot be used for either of those are likely to be dull indeed. Bottom line: if you want to maximize the power of your aspects, maximize their interest.

In addition, you don't want your aspects to overlap. Have them define different parts of your character. Wushu provides three suggestions for aspects, covering different parts of your character. They are **Motivation, Fighting Style,** and **Profession**. Below are example of aspects from *Fate Core*. 

> * **Significant personality traits or beliefs** Sucker for a Pretty Face, Never Leave a Man Behind, The Only Good Tsyntavian Is a Dead Tsyntavian.
> * **The characterâ€™s background or profession** Educated at the Academy of Blades, Born a Spacer, Cybernetic Street Thief. 
> * **An important possession or noticeable feature** My Fatherâ€™s Bloodstained Sword, Dressed to the Nines, Sharp Eyed Veteran. 
> * **Relationships to people and organizations** In League with the Twisting Hand, The Kingâ€™s Favor, Proud Member of the Company of Lords. 
> * **Problems, goals, or issues the character is dealing with** A Price on My Head, The King Must Die, Fear of Heights. 
> * **Titles, reputations, or obligations the character may have** Self- Important Merchant Guildmaster, Silver-Tongued Scoundrel, Honor-Bound to Avenge My Brother.

### Assorted thoughts on aspects from me:

* Phrase them as something your character might say. "I am X so Y". It helps you get in their mindset about the aspect.

* Write out 6 aspects and then sort them by how core they are to your character. Try to express different aspects of the character's personality via them.

* An aspect can be referenced in many situations, it's something that sort of represents a way the character interacts with situations.

* You don't want two aspects that say the same thing. Spread out, explore some other aspects (no pun intended) of their personality.

* Make sure your aspect related to a conflict. Having an aspect that says you're always going to open the door for women is a great personality trait; but the odds of you needing to win a contest to do that are pretty low. (A particularly common example here is *I can/can't escape from things*. You don't need to roll to run away or stand your ground.)

* **If you need help with aspects, I recommend crowd sourcing it to the channel.** It's hard to come up with them sometimes, in my opinion. 

### Special Aspects

The following are two special styles of traits in Wushu. If you so desire, we can discuss using them with your character. 

> **Milestone Traits** - To really get Campbellian on their asses, you should plan out a series of three milestones for any new Trait. Each time the player meets one of these challenges, or makes a milestone choice, the Trait increases by one. For example, a hero trying to master an ancient and cursed weapon might have the following milestones ahead:

> 1. Use the weapon to defeat an enemy in combat.
> 2. Use the weapon to defend an enemy from harm.
> 3. Use the weapon to prevent a fight you want to win.

> At first, using this weapon would mean rolling against the default target number of 2. After their first combat victory, the relevant Trait increases to 3. After successfully defending a hated enemy, the Trait increases to 4. Finally, after learning the true value of human life (awww), the Trait increases to 5. Only those who do not seek power are fit to wield it.

> **Two-Sided Traits** - If you want to drive home a characterâ€™s dramatic arc, consider giving them a pair of opposed Traits like Occult Power and Sanity, Honor and Freedom, or Loved and Feared. These two Traits always have 6 points between them; increasing one means decreasing the other. You could have Occult Power 4 and Sanity 2 (4+2=6), but never Occult Power 4 and Sanity 3 (4+3=7). Pushing either Trait to level 5 means turning the other into a Weakness.

> Unlike normal Traits, these are meant to be adjusted during play. Any time the player makes a choice that pushes in one direction, increase/decrease the Trait ratings accordingly. Do this before the dice are rolled, so the player is always faced with the temptation of quick power. Never let them adjust it back in the other direction right away, though. Choices mean little without consequence.

## Points assignments

You can choose any one of these you'd like to define your character. Your best bet is to list the aspects you want to define for your character *before* you assign them numbers. 

```
5 - Trait 1
4 - Trait 2
3 - Trait 3
1 - Weakness
```

```
4 - Trait 1
4 - Trait 2
4 - Trait 3
1 - Weakness
```

```
5 - Trait 1
3 - Trait 2
3 - Trait 3
3 - Trait 4
1 - Weakness
```

```
5 - Trait 1
5 - Trait 2
1 - Weakness
```

```
3 - Trait 1
3 - Trait 2
3 - Trait 3
3 - Trait 4
3 - Trait 5
3 - Trait 6
1 - Weakness
```

### The Default Trait:

If you do not have a relevant trait to an action, you use what's called the *everything else* trait. Quite simply, everyone gets a a free trait called *everything else* with a number of 2. If you don't have trait related to what you're doing, use 2. 

Example: You want to sing in a musical. You have the "theatre is my life" aspect at 5. Because the musical relates to your "theatre is my life" aspect, you get to use 5 as your difficulty. (It's a roll under system, higher is better.)
What if you don't have that aspect? All three of your aspects relate to video games? Then you're difficulty number is 2.

## Building a character:

* **Step one:**: Write up aspects for your character. Come up with a bunch, it can't hurt to explain your character more. Don't forget to give them a weakness as well.
* **Step two**: Decide what point assignment you'll be using. Stick your aspects into the template.
* **Step three**: Give your character a name. 

You're done!
