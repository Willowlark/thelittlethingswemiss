*Callorian Human*

**Aspects:**
* 5 - I just... can do it you know? *(Desii is naturally intelligent. She catches on to technique and theory quickly and rarely need to study or practice them for a good understand of them. People who study and practice their way to the top can find this natural ability annoying.)*
* 4 - Magic is for the study, not the battlefield *(Desii is an anima pupil, though she is close to the level of a Mage. She has no experience using magic outside of an academic setting.)*
* 3 - Medic! Oh wait, that's me. *(Desii has injured herself. a lot. She's skilled with first aid in the non magical sense. Its an unfortunately talent, given why she has it.)*
* 1 - What's the opposite of cat's grace? *(Desii is the farthest thing from a cat in the sense she never lands on her feet. Her fine motor skills are one thing, but anything that requires coordination of her whole body tends to escape her.)*

**Backstory:** 

Desii was born in Hylley, a kingdom in Callora. Her mother is Hylleian and a rope weaver, her father is a traveling merchant her mother had a few too many flings with. Despite having no true father figure Deseii grow up as comfortably. Her mother's work has her weaving the and repairing the leaf catches used on the rooftops of Hylley building under the great tree. It requires agility and skill, which lead to good pay as her mother is both. 

Desii acquired none of her mother's agility. From a young age Desii was clumsy, but rather than grow out of it with age it seemed to become more and more a part of her. It never stopped her from trying to play with other children or attempt anything she wanted to do but she was never selected first for a team. She excelled in other areas, those that required attention to detail and fine motor skills such as weaving, leatherworking, writing and many more skills. For every thing she failed at she proved skillful in another. 

Recently her mother has stopped climbing the rooftops and has taken easier position coordinating others in her career. Desii, now 20 years old, feels her Mom has worked herself like crazy to keep Desii happy all these years. (She has, but she wouldn't change it for the world.) Her mother is meeting people and finding a new way of life to go with her job change and Desii is looking for a way to give her mother 'her time'. Desii's sense of adventure has spawned from that feeling and she's been planning to leave Hylley for a few months. 

To further that feeling, she's had problems with her Mage mentor being a little more interest in her than teaching her. She's tried to dissuade the man but he's getting more and more persistent. Desii wants to continue her study of anima magic, finding it very enjoyable and a challenge in itself, but won't do so with the mentor acting the way he is. She's used that as reason for leaving town for awhile with her mother and while her mother would be sad to see her daughter leave, she always expected Desii to eventually wander the world a bit. "It's your father in you."

Desii likes change and excitement. Her mood can ebb and flow with the mood around her so she loves being in festivals and happy places. She has an eagerness to *living* which can be infectious to others in turn. She's a fun seeker, as well as curious of everything. Desii is incredibly positive about things, particularly her own failures. She never has trouble getting up again when she has a problem. Desii is 5' 5" with straight light brown hair down to her shoulders. She prefers to wear it down when she can. She has bright blue eyes and the barest hint of freckles. She wears a white blouse with a short sleeve farmers tunic over it. She wears a white hip cape as well, but accompanies this with hide pants and boots. Her favorite color is white and while she would love to wear more of it, she wears the heavier clothing due to her habit of tripping into something every other hour. She has a silver dagger she carries, mostly used in spellcraft, as well as an anima tome in the leather knapsack she usually has on her person.
