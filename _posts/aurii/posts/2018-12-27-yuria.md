excerpt: The once planned Yuria arc, modified to have happened anyway.

# Pre arc

* Yuria is a church inquisitor, effectively a special ops soldier for the Church of Lylalel. She rose through the enlisted ranks quickly before becoming one. She was originally pulled from the enlisted just for name alone, being a Faun. This went over poorly, and Yuria took it as a chip on her shoulder. She strove to be the best Inquisitor on her own merit, making sure to avoid any path that would lead to a cushy noble's position. She would be in the field, in danger, doing Lylalel's work.
* Yuria was on a mission, it was a simple affair with little risk to her. At the same time, another Inquisitor was running a near suicide mission that made hers so simple. They both succeeded the mission, the latter surprising everyone by doing so. Yuria and the other Inquisitor meet in the courtyard as they escape the hostile territory and quickly sync up, Yuria's practiced ability and his wild tendencies complimenting each other. While this man's personality was... uncouth for Yuria's taste, his skill and ability to not only hold his own but watch her back was impressive. He similarly found her to the point and unpolitical, not to mention truly talented. She did take offense to command's need to split the mission into two parts, knowing she could have done both jobs, and that they effectively sent the other Inquisitor to die for his part of the mission, providing no back up or intel.
* The other Inquisitor's name is Cyn Konwy. He is a cat laguz whose been thrown on more suicide missions than anyone else. The papacy considers him expendable, due to his cat laguz nature, and he lives to prove that he can't be killed and is worthy of respect. Cyn is a daredevil and lives for the danger of these missions, and relishes the moment when he returned to command alive and well, mission completed beyond their expectation. He has nothing but the military, originally a street rat in Lyall. While he holds no love for the papacy's attitude to him, he loves the challenging missions that drive him to be better and better. His technique is all self taught and he thrives on instinct. He is insubordinate and incredibly casual for a high ranking military officer, but his success rate and talents speak for him. 
* Yuria had been under pressure for getting a partner for sometime. Her superiors demanded it, she felt most partners would be dead weight. Cyn, after working with Yuria, made a special request to command to partner with her. Between the existing pressure on Yuria and Cyn giving up his take from his latest mission, Command relented and made Yuria take him on as partner. The two would be more valuable as a pair, even if command loses their suicide runner. 
* Yuria was not amused. Cyn is casual and feels no sense of duty to Eraia, only to the thrills and challenges of the mission at hand. He's reckless knowing that command considers him expendable, which has given him a daredevil streak. He takes more risks than needed and Yuria's planning and technique suffer because of it. However, their mission success rate is perfect; command will hear nothing of splitting them.
* During a particularly rough mission they're captured, and their captures strip them down to prevent escape. Cyn sees Yuria's wolf tail and her secret is revealed. They quickly escape anyway, specialists as they are, and the rest of the mission Yuria is unusually quiet. Eventually she asks why he doesn't seem to care. he replies "You're still my partner, aren't you?"
* On the return from their successful mission, Yuria ends up talking to Cyn about the Fauns. He doesn't say much, realizing she just wants to get it on the table so she can move on from this whole thing. However by the end he can't help but sharing he feels her family's practices are fucked up. He says "I get treated like crap, sure, but I'm not my race or my nationality. I am myself, I like myself too; and anyone who doesn't too isn't worth a damn."
* They don't talk much more about the issue, and Cyn says nothing to command. The shared secret does let Yuria see Cyn in a new light, and she starts to grow closer to him. 

# Arc

* Yuria and Cyn are tasked with infiltrating a Drecian city in the Kissaelain territories, in particular to gather any information on the wyverns. Cyn ends up playing the role of a Eraian deserter, fed up with the racism in Eraia and looking to get his revenge. Yuria was to play a captive superior officer of his the Drecian's can interrogate. The two changed the plan when they arrived, they had Yuria go in as a laguz, her damaged ears making her look like one of the beaten and abused laguz slaves already in the camp. It lets her integrate quickly and gather more information via the slaves than she could have as a captive.
* Cyn is interrogated on and off, not truly welcome. Dreca plans to eliminate him when they know everything he does, and he continues to feed them half truths to keep himself alive so he can gain more information. Yuria gains information about the camp layout from the slaves, but is at constant risk of assault by Drecian soldiers or being used in a hunt. Wyvern hunts are much like fox hunts, but with the Wyvern riders hunting a laguz in the plains. 
* The Wyvern roost is setup away from the areas Cyn and Yuria have access to. Wyverns are kept apart from mainlander's, as anything about the pseudo dragons is a military secret. 
* Yuria finds the location of the Wyvern captain's tent, and wants to make a raid of it. To make that happen, Cyn has been going through with one of their original plans, trying to get a Drecian rider to assault Yuria. He was never happy about the plan, but once isolated Yuria could take the man down and get access to his Wyvern's roost and a weapon (which neither of them have in the camp). He's not a fan of putting her at risk like that, but he trusts her judgement as it was her idea. 
* Their plans goes as expected, they raid the Wyvern captain's tent, getting key war information and escaping on a Wyvern. They fly the Wyvern back to Lyall to a warm reception.
