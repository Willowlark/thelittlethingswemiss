# Aspects in Use

## Invocations 

At the cost of one fate point from your pool, you can *invoke* an aspect you think is relevant to the situation at hand. It doesn't have to be your aspect; if you can explain how to use it to your advantage, you can use it. When you invoke an aspect you choose one of the following effects in exchange for your fate point. 

You can only use an aspect once in relation to a given dice roll, no matter how many fate points you have. You can use multiple aspects on a single roll. You also can roll the dice BEFORE you spend a fate point and invoke an aspect. 

* Add a +2 bonus to your total.
* Reroll the dice.
* Challenge an opponent with the aspect. This is describing how the aspect would make things more difficult for the opponent. FOr example, if the opponent is *buried in debris*, you can say they shouldn't be able to reach you easily across the room. If your challenge makes sense, the opponent gets a -2 to their dice total.
* Help an ally with the aspect. Much like challenge, you explain how this aspect should help an ally with their current action. If the logic makes sense, that ally gets a +2 to their dice roll. 

## Compels

Compels are made to test a character, using one of their aspects against them. These are often made by the GM, but the can even be done against yourself! A compel will make things more difficult for your character in the game, but in return you earn a fate point. There are two types of compels to be made.

* Decision compels are where, when faced with a choice, your character takes the harder choice because of an aspect they have. As an example, "if you have a Defiant Streak a Mile Wide, maybe you canâ€™t help but mouth off to the Dean of Discipline when he questions you." You earn a fate point when your character makes that harder choice.
* Event compels are when some kind of troublesome event occurs to your character, related to one of your aspects. If you owe the lord a favor, he asks you for that favor at an ill opportune time. When the troublesome event happens, you earn a fate point. After that you have to deal with the consequences. 

# Four Actions

Whenever you make a roll in Fate, you roll four *Fudge Dice*. These dice have the following sides, `-` `-` ` ` ` ` `+` `+`. You get a `+1` for every plus, and a `-1` for minuses. Blank sides count for `0`. Additionally, when you do one of the below actions you decide which of the 6 approaches best describes what you're doing. You add your approach rating to the dice result you receive. This gives you your dice role total. 

Once you roll, you'll compare to either the other person's die roll or the difficulty rating the GM has set. If your roll is less than the difficulty, you fail the action. If your rolls are equal, you tie, if you have more than the difficulty you succeed.

## Overcome

Overcome is when you have to do something difficult and you need to roll to complete the task. This is your general challenge.

* **Fail**: You either fail to complete the task; or you succeed but at a major cost like if you're hacking the door lock, you set off the alarm.
* **Tie**: You succeed, but with a complication or minor cost.
* **Success**: Success!

## Attack

Attack actions attempt to hurt another person. 

* **Fail**: You miss.
* **Tie**: You hit, but do no damage.
* **Success**: You hit!

## Defending

Defending is used to stop other people from performing an action. You don't actively do these actions, you do them in reaction to someone else. 

* **Fail**: You fail to stop them.
* **Tie**: You tie their action, follow the tie result in their action. 
* **Success**: You tie their action, follow the tie result in their action. 

## Creating an Advantage

When you create an advantage, you do something that will help you indirectly do something. Sighting your target before you shoot, studying before the test, anything you do to improve your odds of succeeding at something else. This advantage is shown in the form of an aspect that you can then use fate points to invoke and gain bonuses from. 

* **Fail**: You fail to create the aspect you wanted, or you accidentally create an aspect that helps your opponents instead.
* **Tie**: You create a *temporary aspect*, or a *Boost*. The boost aspect can only be used once before it disappears.
* **Success**: You create your aspect!

# Stress & Consequences

Damage is calculated by subtracting the value of the Defending action roll from the Attack action roll. If the attacker got a `+5` and the defender got `+2`, the damage is 3 *Shifts*. 

In order to stay in a fight or encounter, any *shifts* of damage you receive must be absorbed. Every character can absorb up to 3 shifts in their Stress Boxes on their character sheet. Once you run out of stress boxes and have more shifts to absorb, you either lose the fight or upgrade to *Consequences*. Stress boxes don't represent wounds if you don't want them too; having no Stress Boxes left can represent being too winded to continue or something similarly non lethal. 

Consequences are another way to absorb stress. There are three levels of consequence. *Mild* consequences are injuries that heal after the fight, like a "Sprained Ankle". *Moderate* heal at the end of the arc, like "Slashed Arm". *Severe* are long term injuries that won't heal till appropriate, like "Broken Leg". Consequences let you absorb 2, 4, and 6 *shifts* of damage in each of the respective consequence levels. In order to do this, you create an injury aspect in the consequence spot. This aspect can then be used against you until it is removed. Consequences create weak points opponents can target. Consequences do not have to be physical injury. Psychological trauma can be a consequence as well. You can only have one consequence of each type.

If you surrender a fight (giving up while you still have Stress Boxes/Consequences) you gain a fate point for doing so. However, you can only surrender a fight before the dice are rolled on an opponent's attack; no surrendering as you get knocked out!
