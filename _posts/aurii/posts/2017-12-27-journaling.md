# Rules

* Journals respect canon.
* Journals should be in character.

# Journal Format

Journals will be *Markdown* format files. These are basically `.txt` files with the extension `.md` instead. The file name is **required** to be the four digit year, the two digit month, and the two digit day of the post, separated by dashes, followed by your character's first name with one more dash leading to the number entry this is. Each new entry should increase the last number. An example is below.

> `2017-12-17-name-{}.md`

Your journal directory will be sorted by newest date first. Of note, **You can write a post in the past.** If you want to backdate a journal entry, just backdate the day you posted it. As this is an in character section, the order the posts appear in is more important than the actual date of writing.

Inside your file you will need the following at the very top of the page:

```
---
title: {Fill_me_in}
categories: aurii_jounral_entry
tags: {Character_first_name_here}
excerpt: {}
---
```

You must fill in the title and tags value. If your character's name is Bob, your tags line should read 
> `tags: bob` (Note the lower case.) 

The excerpt is what will show up on the journal index under the title. It's the tag line or short description of the entry. Your title will appear as a heading of the page automatically. Everything you write after the section above will appear below that heading. You can use [markdown formatting](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) freely. 

If you incorrectly format your file the file will not render correctly or worse, break the website. Format your files correctly. 

# Your index

The index page for your entries, as mentioned before, lists them in chronological order with the newest on top. If you would like to put an introduction section on the page, that can be done.

# What to Journal

Very much up to you.
