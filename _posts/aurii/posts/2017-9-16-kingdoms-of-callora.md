### Places of Interest

* Evard - The capital of Hylley. Evard is a beautiful city dominated by a massive tree in the center of town. The tree's roots occasionally appear in back corners or even on side walks, creating the illusion that the entire city was built upon it's root system. The buildings are made of a white stone that must be plentiful in the area, and while there are less buildings that one would expect in a capital they make up for it most buildings being multistory. The open space is often filled with manicured grassy lots, adding to the overall appeal of the city. The overall appearance is that of place where nature is prominent and respected.

## Laera

### Ruling Class

Tyndall family, descended from original rulers and founders, the Larea family. Inherited throne through blood line, not paternal last name, as the Laerans believe that children inherit their ability to learn from their parents. As an absolute aristocracy, the ruler has a board of advisers, but ultimately makes decisions themselves. The current ruling family is King Tyndall, his wife, and his daughter Afina.

### Culture

The people of Laera are overall sympathetic to the laguz; though stereotyping is still prevalent, discrimination is considered to be a form of ignorance, and is therefore, in poor taste. Furthermore, the current ruler is a huge proponent of the laguz acceptance, and believes they should "welcome the laguz with open arms and open minds".

### Religion

There is no official religion of Laera, though the people there have strong beliefs about the role of learning in an individual's life. Parents are expected to foster learning in their children; therefore, "non-traditional" families are looked down upon. People equate learning more with living a more accomplished life. 

### Military

The kingdom has a military strategy called the "Militia, Money, Men" doctrine. First, there is a standing militia at all times acting for the kingdom. Second, wealthy Laeran individuals can contribute supplies and money to the militia, and in return receive admission to witnessing the Ruler's advising committee in session (The Ruler's Consult, which is considered a massive honor and learning opportunity). Thirdly, young men and women who come Laera to learn can volunteer for the emergency militia, a militia that exists only after all other resources have been depleted, and in return, receive reduced fare on university.
