## Dragon Breaks up Market Brawl

Brawls between Eraian and Drecian forces visiting the city are a dime a dozen in the current political climate, but ones broken up by a dragon are anything but. Witnesses report the fight being started by some Drecians harassing a potion seller in the eastern market. Some bystanders came to the potion seller's aid, starting a brawl between the Drecian unit and their group. It was not long after a two story tall dragon appeared, fighting the Drecian's as well. To Dreca's credit, despite most of the market running in a panic their unit held fast and fought on. 

Not long after an Eraian unit and the city watch got involved, quelling the combat and managing to net the beast. The Eraians insisted on taking custody of the Dragon, on the grounds that it was a "servant of Lyarlel". They managed to catch it in an elephant cage. Even more amazingly, the dragon escaped the cage under Eraian watch not long after. Even the Eraian's have no idea how the dragon escaped, especially with no one seeing it fly off. 

## Drought Continues in Eastern Aurii

The droughts plaguing the once Elbia region of Aurii continue. Treasure hunters are returning without even reaching the Elbian ruins, unable to carry enough water to make the journey. Talks are in place of charting a ship to the eastern coastline and approaching from there, though the group has yet to settle on the terms of the arrangement. Some wish for the hunters to split the finds as they're working together to get there in the first place; others wish to fend for themselves. 

## Council Torn on Who to Blame for Getterwalt Caravan

The Getterwalt's were savagely attacked by an unknown force in the middle of the night a few weeks ago. They reported, based on the quality of the attacker's equipment, a military force attacked them. They couldn't identify who in the dark. Eraians point to Dreca, and Drecians point to Eraia. The Guild Council has been locked up on who to believe for over a week now, despite frequent interviews with the caravaneers in question. The Isolationist party is insistent on evidence before making an accusation formally, while the Expansionists are leaning towards Dreca as the culprit. 

## Council Politics

The Guild Council is currently sitting at 67% Isolationist and 33& Expansionist. Taiver of the Tanner's Guild continues to rally support for the Expansionist agenda, that the 'Guild charter must be amended to keep up with the times'. The Isolationist party, as the Expansionists call their opposition, continue to hold that the Guild Charter is absolute and we do not have the right to amend the forefather's work.

## A Letter from Dryn Wulfa

*Theanovians. Tis a pleasure to read this fine Alamanac as each new issue arrives here. It is quite the shame it takes so long for it to arrive, but that is why we push to the mainland in the first place. We of Dreca look forward to the time we can call ourselves true neighbors of Theanovene, when we can be equals on the mainland. We anxiously await the day.*

## Eraian Trade Route Plagued

Eraia's primary trade route with Theanovene is well traveled, heading southwest through the Eraian towns Ebonary and Effera. Trade then continues over the bay, ships doing the last leg of travel from Ebonary to Lyall. This route is well known and that's left it plagued by attacks. Dreca pushes the front lines ever closer to the route, putting traders on the border of a war zone. Bandit activity from the mountains is a constant, and recently pirate activity has spiked in the bay. It's a dangerous time to be an Eraian caravaneer. 

## Hylley's 176th Melting Festival

Hylley, a kingdom just over the Callorian border, held it's bi annual melting festival this month. The city of Evard is set along a river that sources from the western mountain range. The river dries up when the water freezes higher up in the mountains. Twice a year that ice over melts, flooding into the river canals and filling the town's channels with water. Evard celebrates this event in a grandiose style.

## Trisp's Prodigy

Eraia's town of Trisp has proclaimed one of their students is blessed by Lylalel. The town is more monastery than town, dedicated to the study of light magic. The Cardinal of Trisp states that a girl studying with them has proven to be more proficient with light magic than anyone he's ever seen, leading him to say she's been blessed by Lylalel.

# War Tent

## Wyverns Route more Eraian Camps

Wyverns are the most powerful weapon in Dreca's war chest. The trained pseudo dragons and their riders are riders of death on the battlefield, strafing and turning their enemies into kindling with every run. Little can counter their speed and power, though some Eraian archers have managed to force a retreat with a lucky shot or two. Little is known about Wyverns outside of Dreca, and that adds to their value as a weapon of war. As it stands, the beasts and their riders continue to kite over Eraian camps, keeping the Eraian forces constantly on the move. 

## Eraia Pushing into Kissaelain Territories

The church of Lylalel has announced that Eraian forces will be pushing into the Kissaelain territories, now occupied by Dreca, with renewed vigor. Highlight reasons for the announcement are "those who refuse Lylalel's light shall never best those who embrace it" and "the laguz of the territories need not worry, Lylalel shields all in their darkest hour". The church has gained positive publicity with the refugees of the Kissaelain territories, some of which have joined Eraia's forces as mercenaries. 

# Special: Inside Dreca Occupied Seria

*This report comes directly from a laguz who escaped the Drecian occupied city of Seria. The account below is not the opinion of the Theanovene Alamanac or Theanovene government as a whole.*

Whatever the Drecians might tell you about their *invasion* of our city, it's a lie. The Drecians treat us laguz as second class citizens at best; slaves at worst. They enforce strict curfews for those who aren't kept under thumb by an officer or unit, and they tell us when to eat, work, and sleep. They use laguz labor to haul equipment, build weapons, and clean up after their Wyverns. I simply... simply pity those whose entire day is serving the Drecians hand and foot. Some might say that's what an occupying army does, but this simply isn't right! Nothing about this is right...

# Rumor Mill & Classifieds

## Pirate Problems: Actually a Rabellion?

It's common knowledge that the Eraian trade route has a new found pirate problem. What few people know is many of these attacks involved Kouneli crews. This author poses the question that if the Kouneli are unhappy with their annexing into Eraia, is it not possible the Kouneli are manning this pirate crews in an attempt at rebellion against their oppressors?

## Wynne and Dreca Alliance?

Dreca has sent ships north to the island nation of Wynne, looking for an ally against Eraia. The nations have similarities in their island status, and also in the fact both are hated by Eraia. It's possible Wynne could see this as an opportunity to cut off one threat using another; having Dreca and Eraia fight to their last man before sweeping in and finishing off the survivor. 

## Legends of the Lakes

Rumor has it that deep in the eastern and western mountain ranges lie a pair of lakes. They say with in the lakes a trio of weapons rest, each imbued with a type of magic. Many have gone searching for these weapons but not a trace of the weapons was found. The lakes themselves are mapped, if difficult to get to. At the very least explorers are rewarded with one of the most beautiful views in all of Aurii.
