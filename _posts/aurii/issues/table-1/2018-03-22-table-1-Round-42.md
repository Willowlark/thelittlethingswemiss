**Bill** - *2018-03-22*

Desii finally seems to drop her guard; she no longer has her tome page bookmarked with a finger and her wide combat stance is lost as she taps her heels together lightly. She looks around the area for a moment before looking to you with a sheepish smile. 

"Maybe I can elaborate more somewhere... less public?" she says with a small awkward laugh. She motions for you to follow her as she heads down the street with her tome under her arm, her eyes glued to the ground in front of her and certainly not avoiding eye contact with onlookers to your group's little show.

Desii leads you a few blocks before stopping in front of an inn. It's a tired looking building, with faded wood and what paint is left has lost it's sheen. The door sign has lost it's detailing as well, making it very hard to read 'Crow's Kilt'. 

"I helped these people out during the attack that did all the damage around town. It's not the nicest inn in town but their kindness has more than made up for it." Desii says as she walks through the front yard of the inn.

"Hello Desii." you hear from inside not a moment after she opens the door. A man who looks as tired as the building stands behind the bar, idly washing glasses. He has sandy blonde hair and lines on his face that make up look far older than the late thirties man should. He has a scar under his right ear. "Found friends?"

"Something like that Dain." Desii says with a smile. "Is Saila not here?" 

"She's meeting with the mayor along with representatives of the rest of the businesses. We're going to have to do something, though I doubt anything we can do will be effective." he says. Desii only replies with a sympathetic look. Dain motions to sit down and Desii sits, waving you to join her. 

"So... to answer your question from before Mr... Aldus, Danthres passed away quite a long time ago. He left behind his work in his journal series, which he sent to numerous friends. Those friends have circulated the copies a bit, but it's still a tough work to get a hold of." Desii looks at Aldus's face and smiles reassuringly. "I said before I would not give you the book, but I have no problem sharing it's contents with you. We can look through it together here.' she says.

Desii looks awkwardly between Nokri, now nursing her drink at the bar, and the two men in front of her. She thinks for a moment to invite Nokri closer to hear better, but that thought is silenced remembering just how poorly her last inquiry went over. She decides the best option is to just get started on the book and promptly pulls Danthres's Journal from her bag. 

Desii carefully turns the pages of the tome. Her gaze is intense as she skims page after page. She frowns when flipping through a few particular pages, but other than that shows no interest in any of the other pages. The number she hasn't read dwindles and dwindles, the left side of the book becoming larger than the right. The journal is quite long and takes forever (at least in Aldus's mind) to go through. 

Finally Desii turns to a page and stops. She leans in a bit, then she smiles up at Aldus. "There is something here." she says at last. She reads it more throughly before sitting up again and explaining.

"It's more of theoretical cure than anything else, I should start with that. Danthres, much like with his lust potion, never tested it." she pauses, realizing what she said could crush Aldus's hopes. "Ah, but there's a reason he's so well regarded. None of the potions he theorized failed." she says quickly to ease his mind.

"The original concept was something to bring out the beast in a human. Danthres's theories were built based on combining the effects of ingredients and potions he knew the effects of. He took *Brakehweed*, which has the effect of putting people in a bit of a berserker state, then combined that with *Calholly*, a native plant from Wynne. If I remember correctly... Right, Calholly is poisonous to humans, yet serves as a wonderful spice to the laguz people. Anyway, that and few other mundane ingredients was to cover the animalistic part. The second set of components started with *Crysalin*, an Eraian plant that actually becomes water when it dies. It transforms from seed to water, it's quite unique in that. After that... oh my, it calls for *Denuh*..." Desii pauses, lost in thought completely. 

"Sorry, right. Denuh is a mineral stone that's found in Elbia, or well, was found in Elbia. Or I suppose I should say was found in Elbia. Any piece of Denuh would do, based on the recipe, but it's still quite difficult to find the stone. Be...yond that..." she trails off, heading back into the book. "That's it. Everything else isn't too hard to access. Run of the mill stuff." 

Desii gives you a moment to process, all the more helpful since she speaks quickly. Each of you recognize one of the components in a heartbeat. Nokri saw Brakehweed experimented on laguz in Drecian occupied area of the Kissaelain territories. It didn't take long before command gave up on that avenue, to volatile. There's no self respecting Wynnite wolf who doesn't know Calholly; both to prevent the Wynnites from eating it and because it's just that good. Denuh was one of many rare minerals of Elbia, something else lost to her fall. Eliran's met a handful of people in the past with Denuh accessories, elders who lives in Elbia in days before her collapse. The only thing you don't know the exact location of is the Crysalin, though you at least have a direction to head in.

"I... can't help with most of these... At least to any more specific locations than I've already given." Desii says. "Except for the Crysalin. I happen to know it grows out by Trisp, on the coastline. It's always been a fascinating plant to me." she says sheepishly. 

"They say drinking Crysalin water is like nothing you've ever tasted." Dain contributes from the bar. "Like alcohol without the alcohol." Desii nods to the bartender before turning back to the pages. When she looks up again this time, she closes the book with a bookmark on the page of the potion.

"The brewing looks like something you're going to want to have a skilled person do... You won't need the lead brewer of Theanovene's guild no, but not a total amateur. Shouldn't be hard to find." She says. She then smiles at Aldus. "There's definitely a cure for you. Isn't it wonderful?"

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-03-26*

The drink was quite satisfying. Not what Nokri was used to, but not half bad. She smiled to herself as she finished it off. Her mind started to wander from the conversation, but she occasionally picked up bits. *Calholly,* she thought. *What a fun plant. And I'd sure like to see that guy eat something with brakehweed in it. Hehe.*

As Desii finished listing her ingredients, Nokri decided she had enough and that she didn't need more information. A good walk was what she needed now. There was no way she was going to gather those ingredients on her own, but the recipe gave her some ideas for new brews to try out. Maybe one of them would be the cincher to securing her vast wealth, like a potion to reverse male pattern baldness that would be all the rage among balding nobles. Getting up from the chair, she stumbled a bit and nearly tripped before steadying herself on the bar. Shaking it off, she once again went for the exit and went outside. Still unfamiliar with the town but not exactly wanting to stick around in a busy square, the began heading the way they originally came, aiming to reach the town limits and see what was on its outskirts.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-03-26*

Aldus sits at the table for what feels like an eternity watching Desii painstakingly comb through each page of the tome? Journal? Book? He of course is extremely thankful for this lead but *this is taking forever!!* He fidgets anxiously - bobbing his leg, running his fingers through his hair, counting the floorboards - anything to make time pass. 

Finally she speaks! The actual ingredients themselves don’t confort him either. Brakehweed sounds especially terrifying. Calholly he’s familiar with, just the name of it makes him nostalgic for a meal from home, who knew it might be able to help him with this? Hopefully he can find some on the mainlands as well. Crysalin sounds like something that’s not even real and Denuh seems like it will be especially hard to find. 

Finding someone to actually brew the potion sounds like the least of his worries. He scratches a small list down in the small journal he keeps in his bag - which he rarely uses. His face must be twisted in dome doubtful expression because Desii follows up with some much needed words of encouragement. 

“Yes, it is” He flashes a large heartfelt smile her way “Thank you Desii, you’ve given more hope then I have had in years in just a few short hours. It seems I have a lot of work ahead of me. I don’t know exactly what plans you may have but if you’ve nothing pressing I’d invite you to come along with us to wherever we travel to next.” He goes onto explain their tentative plan on traveling to Trisp and in doing so misses Nokri leaving the bar and stumbling outside.
