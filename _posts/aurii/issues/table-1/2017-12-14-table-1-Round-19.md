**Bill** - *2017-12-14*

Despite the lute player's wild dive knocking Nokri and Aldus both back into the room in a tumble, the door does manage to swing close with a click. Not a moment too soon, as cannonball sized fists start banging on the door. If you squint, it almost looks like the door is bending inward with every hit. 

"Get back here you rat! Don't think we can't get through a measly door!" comes bellowing from the hallway.

**Eliran (Halim)** - *2017-12-17*

Groaning Eliran rolled off of whoever he crashed into and sat up, _Note to self, don't dive into closing doors_. Looking at the two, probably bewildered stangers, Eliran couldn't help but let out a little sass, "wow thanks for the help dear strangers." he remarked. Not waiting for their response, Eliran starts to try and push a dresser in front of the door as a way to barricade it. Clearly struggling, he appeals towards Aldus, "Sorry but could you please help me move this? These guys are the type to maim or kill first, and ask questions later."

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2017-12-17*

"What the *[censored]*" Nokri muttered. The small bout of action bumped her shoulder into the wall, the one still healing thanks to those lovely Drecan soldiers in Theanovene, and she bitterly rubbed it. "And who in the world are *you*?" she asked. Turning to Aldus with slight suspicion, she asked "you don't know him. Do you?" Nokri had half a mind to open the door and throw him back out into the hallway before the door inevitably came crashing down. Any repair fees would be going on their hotel bill and she was not going to stand for that. Back to the stranger who had impressively managed to roll himself into the room, she said "you better start explaining fast."

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-18*

After their strange and breif conversation, Aldus helps Eliran into the armoire. "You'd better hope this works lute boy" he says as he firmly closes the door and steps back to where Nokri is. He puts on his best surprised face and braces himself for whatevers coming next.
