**Bill** - *2018-01-04*

You make your way through the crowded streets of the desk festival. Everything is lit up by torch and fire light and people run around gaily. With Nokri in Aldus's arms they assume the little girl simply wore herself out with the festivities. Twice you encounter men dressed in the same fashion as the ones you escaped from but are able to turn a different way to avoid them. They're still actively searching for you from the looks of it, though you have yet to spot Orar and Lac again. 

Your most recent turn brought you into the festival square. The massive tree in the center has floating paper lanterns all about it with lights inside them. They're beautiful and accent the warm light coming from below. It unusual just how many fires are lit through the festival, while every one is well contained and maintained, half the fires would light the city. 

Your destination is completely across the fairgrounds, with you entering from the western side of the festival and the inn in question is through the southeastern exit. In your path is rows of festival stalls, a large circle of people around a dancing troupe, and some large tents.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-01-08*

Aldus takes a second to marvel at the dancers and other festivities occurring through the square, he desperately wishes he could participate in the fun but that is decidedly not an option at this point. 

Despite the ambiance and energy created by the festival and lights Aldus presses forward following Eliran to the inn that he can only hope will provide the reprieve he so desperately needs right now. The pain in his rib stabs at him violently with each step and is only made worse by the weight of Nokri lying limply in his arms. He grits his pointed teeth through the pain and continues onward weaving through the crowd.

**Eliran (Halim)** - *2018-01-08*

Reaching the square, Eliran gave an impressed whistle, looking back to Aldus' face of wonderment  "It really is amazing isn't it? I come to this festival whenever I can, and it still stuns me every time." He said before facing forward and stepping into the festival area, planning on going through the crowded area to get as close to the inn as possible with the purpose of blending into the crowd. As he continued to lead Aldus, Eliran thought back to the kerfuffle where he met the bowman and the girl. ".....I'm really sorry you won't be able to enjoy it because of this mess" he said. 

As he felt his expression sadden, Eliran made sure to keep his back to them, not wanting to ruin what little of the festival they'd be able to see now that he got them involved.  _I killed a man_ he thought to himself, feeling a heavy weight on his shoulders. It wasn't the first time Eliran had killed, it was part of his growing up fending for himself after he left his home, but that didn't make the guilt that came with the killing any smaller. Thinking back on it, he knew he could have probably incapacitated the man without killing him, but with the number and the threat to the two behind him, Eliran hoped the act would make the gang members think twice before continuing their chase, that the cost outweighed the benefit of grabbing one measily bard. Thinking about it now, the choice probably had the complete opposite affect.  _Stupid stupid stupid_ he told himself as he mentally hit himself in the head. Shaking his  head, he focused on looking less like somebody who had just killed a man and more like a festival goer, and looked back to Aldus again, "This way," Eliran said as he made a turn, "we should be there soon."

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-01-10*

It was warm and comfortable. Nokri felt like a little kid, safe at home after dozing off on a lazy summer afternoon. It felt more peaceful and relaxing in that moment than it had been for a very long time. She tilted her head, rubbing it onto whatever it was leaned against, which in her dazed state she thought to be a pillow. But something felt off, and it started nagging in the back of her head. This was not her pillow. And what were those sounds? It was silent just a second ago.

Reality hit her like a sack of bricks and she jolted to her senses, waking up and practically falling out of Aldus's arms. "Wh... huh?" Nokri's memory was hazy and she had absolutely no idea what was going on. Aldus was recognizable, but who was this other punk? She tried to stand, struggling away from Aldus and to her feet as the world spun and her ears screeched. 

"Somebody tell me what is happening. Now." Her natural Drecan accent slipped out in full force, but other matters were more pressing at the moment. Memories were slowing starting to come back. The inn, and the punk who randomly showed up while being chased and dragged them into it. *Was I hit?* The festival lighting and loud atmosphere only served to further disorient Nokri, who was experiencing something akin to the world's worst hangover that affected her entire body. She glared at the boys while waiting for her double vision to return to normal, noticing they weren't exactly in tip-top condition either compared to the lively festivalgoers around them. *Oh great. We're on the run, aren't we. Uugh.* She wiped her face with a sleeve, taking note of the dried blood from a previous nosebleed. "This is just great."
