**Bill** - *2018-04-02*

The three of you catch up with Dain and Saila as he approaches one of the few two story buildings in the town. Judging by the size you imagine it's an assembly hall and as Dain swings open the door your assessment proves sound. The long benches that make up the seating of the hall are pushed against the walls of the hall. Almost two dozen injured lay around the room, swaddled in blankets. It seems the hall has been turned into a field hospital of sorts. It's further confirmed by two women dressed in white walking between the injured parties. 

Dain enters, looks quickly across the room. Saila makes a beeline for a woman you recognize from the square this afternoon; Tamus called her Frin. 

"Frin! We must rally the guard, one of the children has been taken!" Saila calls, still halfway across the room. Frin turns, her face drawn with heavy lines and bags around her eyes.

"Saila... Forgive me for asking, but this is true correct?" Frin asks. "We're stretched so thin right now, there's little to spare for... your issues."

"Frin, I swear to you! On which ever God you'd like!" Saila says, now in front of the older woman. Dain jogs up behind his wife, placing his hands on her shoulders comfortingly. "A man in a white cloak grabbed a girl with twin blonde braids! Which of the girls is wearing her hair that way right now?" Saila says.

Frin closes her eyes and thinks for a moment. "I... I don't think anyone. Do we have any travelers with children in town?"

"No we don't Frin. It has to be a girl from town." Dain says.

"Still... Did anyone else see this? Dain?" The man looks down at the ring on his left hand, resting on his wife's shoulder.

"I... did not. I believe Saila wholeheartedly." Dain says with conviction. Frin smiles, but there's a tinge of sadness in it.

"The first thing to do then is to find all the girls in town... We have little man power, but it can't take more than an hour..." Frin starts. She's interrupted by Saila.

"We can't wait! I saw the man ride east, we must rally the guard and go after her!" Saila says, stepping out of her husband's reach.

"Saila, the guard are the injured men and women around you on the floor! You truly think they're in the condition to aid us?" Frin frowns at Saila. "They fought tooth and nail to keep us safe two nights ago; I shant bother them unless we can confirm the truth!" Frin says, frustration seeping into her tone.
