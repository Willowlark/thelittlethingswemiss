Desii's grip on her tome seems to lighten a bit as Aldus placates. Nokri stepping forward as well initially seems to easy Desii more, yet the more Nokri speaks the tighter the hold becomes. 

"Yes, I am Desii Manette of Hylley." the girl says. "The child says one thing and you say another thing... whoever you are." she adds pointedly to Aldus. "What is the truth? What relationship do you have with Zaimar?" Desii looks left and right, seeing one or two onlookers to the stand off. Her foot shuffles slightly, though her eyes remain locked on the three of you.

"Will I would speak with you I don't yet trust if I put this book down you'll not drug and capture me. I'd have you earn that much trust before we sit and chat like old friends."

**Eliran (Halim)** - *2018-03-12*

Eliran steps forward with his hands raised to show no weapons and placate the girl.  He crouched down and very slowly put his bow on the ground, "regardless of what nokri says, we mean no harm, " he began, "as far as we were told, you left the Zaimar and took his spellbook or something" he continued to slowly put his lute case down as well, "Aldus and I took his quest because according to him, with the use of that stolen book Aldus could be cured of his disorder. Since I myself am on the way to an Eraian archery tournament," Eliran gestured towards his bow, "and Aldus was going to Eraia to look for potential cures there, we thought there was no harm in also finding you. We have no intention of using force for any of this." 

Eliran then looked behind towards nokri and back to Desi, frowning "as for her, I only know she was traveling with us in hope for some reward, and I'd honestly be happy if she left. Since I met her, she has only feigned knowledge, and often times lied or tried to mislead others for her own profit." He crossed his arms "Take her on your journey with you if you are worried about what she says about us, I don't want to travel with somebody who so easily lies and attacks their companions."
