**Bill** - *2018-01-03*

Orar's jaw drops as Aldus drops from the window. Lac, who was facing Orar rather than Aldus's corner of the room, turns and shouts. 

"Are you people insane?!" He clomps over to the window and looks over the side, frantically searching for where you ended up. In Aldus's escape both of the men miss Eliran's exit until it's too late to stop the mistral. As Eliran get his last look of the room he can see Orar running for the door with Lac has his eyes locked on the bard.

**Eliran (Halim)** - *2018-01-04*

"Ok lets go," Eliran said, seeing that Aldus had the Nokri in hand once again, "The inn is a bit far but we shouldn't have any problems getting there." He said, leading the way. Using his knowledge of the streets and the large crowds that were still moving around thanks to the festival, Eliran slowly walked Aldus and Nokri, to the inn that he had originally planned on staying in, which was a little farther from the festivities and towards the towns northern entrance. The innkeeper was one he had deals with before, and he knew was trustworthy, so even if the goons did come a knocking, the group should get some form of warning before their escape was cut off.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-01-04*

Aldus repostions his bow on his back and picks up Nokri bridal style, she still hasn't moved but her breathing is steady so Aldus pushes concern for her out of him mind till he can find a place to lay her down. Eliran has offered him a room and to find a healer *I could really use one* he thinks, the pain in his rib becoming sharp with the weight of Nokri in his arms. 

“Lead the way, Eliran” He says, hoping there will be a healer available for them and also that his gut feeling on Eliran is accurate and he’s not leading him to some sort of set up or trap. He pushes the thought from his head.
