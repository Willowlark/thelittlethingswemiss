**Bill** - *2017-11-16*

The observatory's entrance hall is larger than it should be. In front of you is grand staircase that branches into the left and right balconies. The is a door way to your right and two to the left. The wall of the lower level are either large charts or bookshelves. The center of the lower level has a massive red rug laid out on it. A table and chair set stands on the rug. 

From down the stairs an old man comes trapsing down. He has a grey beard of a sizable length and is dressed in well tailored brown robes. You can tell by how slow his hurried pace is he's long past the age of quick movements. 

"Can you two put the bar by the door in?" he says. (ooc: He assumes you do.)

He slows down a bit which makes the reason for his hurried pace apparent. He walks across the red rug and beckons you over to the table. 

"Well hello. Quite the strange way to meet. I'm Osbury Nonim, I'm watching the observatory for the owner. We're dear friends you see." He looks between the two of you. "Well. I don't expect you came in here for an interest in the stars anyway. We all have our reasons to avoid a confrontation with that lot." He says with a flick of the eyes to the door. "I must ask you, in return for shelter from their ilk you share your story. I have one of my own and frankly this is the kind of act I must take to advance it. I can promise excellent tea and buscuits, if that's any consulation." He smiles kindly enough but you can tell this isn't the joke of a man old enough to be your grandfather. He plops into one of the arm chairs around the table, placing the book that rested on it's seat in his lap. He waves in the direction of the upper left (ooc: ftr that's the south western) door; a quick glance in that direction reveals the skirts of a maid turning down the corridor. You can only assume she's off to fulfill that promise of tea and buscuits.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2017-11-20*

Nokri's eye twitched as she noticed the old man coming downstairs, and she nudge Aldus to start walking faster. But it was too late, he called out to them and they were morally obligated to stop and acknowledge his existence. "Ooh boy. Here we go," she muttered under her breath.

“Hello,” she greeted sweetly. “My name is Nokri, pleasure to make your acquaintance, sir. Um… To be wholly honest, we are in a bit of a hurry at the moment.” She really was not one for sticking around and chit-chatting, even if they had all the time in the world. Nokri would rather tear off a fingernail than willingly share her life story with this guy, but she courteously followed him to the rest area and stood next to one of the temptingly plush chairs. *Tea and biscuits? Dang this guy is good.* Such a thought occurred when her stomach let out a betraying growl.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-11-20*

Aldus's eyes dart from the old man, to Nokri and back a few times not sure of this man's intent. He was expecting more of a scholarly attitude in this place, mostly full of people with their head in books, focused one thing or another - far too engaged to care about  the likes of him and Nokri. Apparently not. While his request is quite odd it's much better than being out there. 


“My name is Aldus, and thank you for your kind offer Mr. Nonim. A light snack would be greatly appreciated, although we cannot stay long I'm afraid.”
