**Round 1**

The less popular West Market of Theanovene is no less busy than the main, Eastern Market. While getting permission to build a stall in the Eastern Market is an impressive achievement, getting a stall in the Western Market is about as difficult as convincing a dog to wag his tail. All sorts of assorted curio shops crop up overnight (and disappear just as quickly) in the Western Market which make it an interesting place to explore, if you keep your wits about you. 

A few such explorers have entered the Western Market today. Despite entering separately and having never met, the two are following the same rumor to the same place; a small potion shop. This shop has garnered quite a bit of fame (or perhaps infamy) for it's potions both not doing what they're supposed to and doing all sorts of odd and interesting things instead. The latter is certainly something to make anyone curious, especially for someone who has something odd and interesting to resolve. 

(OOC: OOC stands for *Out of Character*, we have channels for this buy I may throw them in as the GM. I've set a scene here to bring you all together, but going forward it's what your characters want to do, and how they interact with things and people.

Don't forget to describe your character for the rest of us, no harm in details! First posts are a nightmare, if you're stuck just describe what you're doing at the market.)

**Heroth** - *2017-10-02*

Amidst the crowd walks a shrouded figure concealed by a tattered hood and worn robes. His dark eyes are hidden behind his black wavy hair, and he walks with his head down blending into the sea of people unnoticed and drawing no attention. Hidden beneath his shrouds a string of tomes hang by his waist on a striped leather belt. He is the dark mage Ewan, and large busy crowds like this have often proved that if you keep an ear to the ground, a busy market of common folk can prove a useful place to gain information unnoticed, listening to rumors and learning of questionable characters. 
The streets are buzzing with talk of strange magic and misterious potions. Perhaps this is nothing more than a novice mage who has not master his potion-making craft, but Ewan is not the type of person to expect the best case scenario. Above the busy street walking across the tops of market tents a silver cat like specter watches over Ewan, staying by his side. The cat spirit goes unnoticed, keeping above the line of sight of your average market dweller and staying in tune with any danger that might come to it's companion. As Ewan approaches the rumored potion shop, the Silver Spirit Knoll becomes uneasy and disappears into a mist above the entrance of the shop. Ewan pretends to be interested in buying a potion as he tries to determine if they pose any danger to the people of the town.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2017-10-02*

A neat row of crates covered by a simple sheet served as a makeshift table for vials and bottles of many shapes and sizes. Some had labels scribbled on, most were blank. Nokri herself was barely visible to passer-by behind these crates, sitting cross-legged on the ground with her back to the wall and chewing on some crackers from the general shop she was set up in front of. The owner very generously let her set up shop in this prime location for a week in exchange for curing (and keeping quiet about) his wife’s awful foot fungus.

At first glance, Nokri appeared standoffish yet unimposing. She was obviously not native to Theanovene what with her tanned, freckled skin and bright blonde hair that was braided and tied back with a bandana. But she had been around long enough to establish herself within the city. Her appearance was tidy in a light long sleeved shirt and long skirt and she always smelled subtly of herbs. Occasionally she would warily peek out over her merchandise, scanning the throngs of people for any gullible chumps or past customers who would’ve been less than pleased with their purchase and perhaps seeking her out to complain.

    Several hours ago this spot was perfectly encompassed in shade. But now, the sun had shifted and begun to cast light on her wares. The different colored liquids within refracted a speckled rainbow across her face. The regulars she was kind to had been spreading news of her wares and once or twice an hour another stall somewhere in the market would refer someone her way, not to mention all the great traffic from the general store. Travelers looking to stock up on medical supplies, children with bedridden grandparents, a couple of bored teens with a stupid bet, and all sorts of people passed her way. Whenever she noticed a new customer approach Nokri would stand up, dust off her skirt, don her brightest customer service smile, and call out “good day!”

**Ienzo (john g)** - *2017-10-02*

As Ienzo wonders around the market looking for anything that catches his attention. He makes sure to keep the hood from his navy blue cloak covering his long black hair and dark circles under his eyes. His large figure makes it hard for him to blend in properly. As he wonders he overhears a group of kids talking about the potion shop he has heard about. Without trying to seem suspicious he ask the kids for directions to the shop. After they tell him they run off laughing and giggling, he could hear one of them say something that sounds like, "he is far braver than us I would go nowhere near that creepy shop.". With that bit of information he decides to take the path the kids described to him. As he nears the shop in question he sees another person enter the shop. After waiting a moment he follows the person in. As he enters he sees two people in the shop, "Hello everyone".

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-10-02*

Theanovene - This is where Aldus has ended up. It has taken one ship ride to the mainland and a trek through Callora to get here, but he's here. He was told by a fellow laguz and bookkeeper in his homeland of Wynne that there is a potions seller here that may have something to cure his unique aliment. Aldus is intrigued - obviously, seeing as he was willing to travel all this way on hearsay, if a bit leary of the consequences this potion in question may or may not have. The climate has been getting consistently warmer the further south he has traveled - something new to Aldus, but not unwelcome.  A thin sheen of sweat gathers on his face and behind both sets of ears. 

The western market is busy - much busier than the ones at home, he notes as his deep emerald eyes scan the wares of each merchant. He pauses briefly to check a poorly draw map he acquired from a barmaid at an inn the night before. 

“It should be right around here somewhere?” he says, head moving side to side Just then he spots two hooded figures standing in front of what seems to be a makeshift sellers stall of sorts - judging by the array of colored liquids and powders set out on display. 

“Busy place” Aldus says under his breath as he approaches to join the two figures already at the stall. “Seems I didn't hear of the dress code” Aldus say to the two hooded figures in front of him.

**Tikur (Kurtis)** - *2017-10-03*

Walking through a market was usually not a stressfull task, but add a crate full of questionable potion materials and 3 little ones clamboring all around him, it may be a bit taxing.  But he was never one to shy from helping people especially an old woman.  "C'mon kids dont you have anything more fun to do?" Tikur asked, "Nope!" They all cheerfully responded, seemingly determined to  drive him crazy.  He sighed and continued on through the vibrant an colorful market  place.  "Now where in Lylalel's tits is this shop?" he said under his breath as he moved to a side street and set down the crate. "Now lets take a look at that map" he mutterd digging through his pack.  As he dug through the pack the kids clambored around him and started to badger him about nonsensical things.  Tired of the kids he used a little bit of magic to zap them on the nose to send them on their way.  Luckliy it worked and with a playful laugh they darted away weaving into the crowd.  TIkur stood up and streched out, putting his brown hair back into place and getting some grit out of his ear.  He yiped as he ripped an odd bug that wanted to make some of the fur on his ear a home.  He shouldered his pack, picked up the crate and headed on down the road blending into the crowd determined to find that potion shop. As he walked down the path he enjoyed the hustle and bustle and the cornucopia of  individuals.  Chuckling he was glad he wore his family armor as he noticed some shady characters in the alleys.  He continued on and eventually arrived at the shop.  "Finally, I can get rid of this crate" he sighed.  He headed inside and set the crate down, straightening his longsword and spellbook he looked at the gathering of people and wondered aloud "now where is the potion maker..."
