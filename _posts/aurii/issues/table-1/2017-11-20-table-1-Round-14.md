**Bill** - *2017-11-20*

Osbury chuckles at Nokri's traitorous stomach. "Well, you are unfortunately stuck with a bit of a wait." he says. "The entrance we just barred is the only visitor entrance for the building. Even if I knew where any of the servant entrances were I'd be a poor housesitter if I let you wander about the private sections of the building. We can watch the courtyard and wait for those rapscallions to pass through, then I'll hold you no longer. That is the deal, else you may try your luck outside?" he finishes with a smirk into his newly arrived cup of tea. He knows which of the options is more suitable for you. 

"So tell me. Why might you be avoiding our southern *visitors*; despite your heritage?"

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-11-22*

Aldus helps himself to a seat at the table making a point that he’s taking his chances with Osbury. “My isn't story isn't all that interesting really. Came here from Wynne. As to why we are avoiding those lovely people outside, well I'll leave that explanation to my companion here. I do not know the entire story myself, only that we got into some trouble with the likes of them earlier and would not care to repeat that encounter.” Aldus's looks pointedly at Nokri, hoping she’ll give the old man some story to listen to, weather the truth or not he wouldn't know, nor care.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2017-11-23*

“If you must know… Despite my appearance, I am *not* Drecan,” Nokri firmly announced (OOC: Unreliable Expositor). She was relieved that Aldus hadn’t spouted anything unnecessary and decided upon a short story to appease this old guy as soon as possible. “I want nothing to do with those scoundrels. By Lylalel, I’m Eraian.” She paused for dramatic effect, then softened her gaze. She finally slumped into an armchair and looked at the ground. Her voice slightly shook as she continued, “I’m from a very rural farm town along the border that was destroyed years ago in the conflict. I never knew my father. I speculate he might have been Drecan, but my mother raised me all by herself while being shunned by our neighbors. We both worked so hard to survive, and when the army showed up…”

Tiny tears welled up in her ears, but she bashfully wiped them away. “I’m sorry sir. I just miss her so much. That was a horrible day. S-she… was shot down while I ran and I couldn’t do anything to save her. I don’t know why those men are after me. Perhaps they have me confused with someone else. They were yelling all sorts of nonsense.” She clenched her fist. “*Oh!!* It makes me *so* furious. May God smite them down and give them what they deserve for the atrocities they’ve committed.” Nokri gave a nod of thanks at the maid who delivered their tea and took a big gulp after the story, strongly placing the cup back on the saucer with a loud *tink* sound.
