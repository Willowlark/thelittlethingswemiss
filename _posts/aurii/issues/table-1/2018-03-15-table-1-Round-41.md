Desii takes one last look across each of your group's faces before her shoulders sag and some of the tension leaves her. 

"I have the book Zaimar wants, yes. I did technically steal it from him. It is a collection of potions made by Danthres Uilosra, a visionary in the field of potion work. That said, Danthres was expelled from every college there is for continuing research on potions that can permenantly change a person in ways they may not want." she hesitates for a moment. "One of those ways is a love potion. While there's no record of a successful usage, Danthres has a recipe for a potion that, on ingestion, causes powerful lusting for the person the potion is brewed for. Danthres's description is rather... perverse, and the victim won't even realize their thoughts aren't their own."

"As... arrogant as it feels to say, Zaimar is quite obsessed with me. He has been for a few years. I ignored him, never thinking he'd act maliciously... But he was trying to brew that potion. When I found out, I knew I had to leave. And I wasn't going to leave him the instruction manual, in case he changed his target to some other poor girl." She looks down at her feet, lightly twisting one foot into the dirt. 

"A-anyway. I infer when you say transform you mean into your laguz form. I'm not familiar with Danthres's work myself, I don't really do potions. But if there's anyone whose got a fix for such an odd problem, it's Danthres Uilosra. I... won't give you the book, given why I have it in the first place, but I can happily share notes." Desii smiles lightly at the Naissankari. "I'd certainly like to help you if I can."

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-03-19*

As Desi speaks everything starts to make a lot more sense. When she tells them the book is by a man names Danthres, about his less than conventional methods, Aldus feels conflicted, *would the potion even be safe for him to take if he could get his hands on it? Would it be worth it.* He doesn't have much time to consider this because as Desi elaborates on Zaimar, Aldus becomes disgusted. She explains the man’s plans for brewing a potion designed for less than savory means. And that Zaimar intended to use it on her. Aldus face screws up into disgusted expression. Until know he hadn’t suspected any ill will in the man but now, Aldus was revolted he even spoke to a man of such low caliber.  

“You did the right thing Desi, you are a very brave girl. Please know I did not suspect this from him and in no way support him. If you are willing to help me I would be grateful. I’m not sure how I feel about this man’s work as whole, but if there is something in that book that can help I have to pursue it. Do you know where I might find this Danthres Uilosra? And if it’s not too much to ask, perhaps you could provide me with a copy of the pages relevant to me? I doubt I would be able to decipher what the pages hold. I realise this is alot to ask of you of course”

**Eliran (Halim)** - *2018-03-19*

Eliran frowned at the explanation Desi offered, and his frown slowly turned to disgust as she continued. By the time she finished, he spat, cursing, "_kyst_ I'm sorry" he said, "if I had known I'd have burned the man's study before helping him.." 
Eliran shook his head, "I figured that since you had proclaimed he'd protect the bar girl he was a good man... but so much for that." 
Eliran stood up, picking up his lute and bow, when suddenly his stomach growled loudly, he looked mildly embarrassed, "sorry about that... anyways, since we have no reason to chase you anymore, does anybody want to go somewhere where we can get food? I haven't eaten today and it's already past noon." 
He looked towards Desi then back to Aldus, "it'd be a good chance for you two to discuss the potions and stuff as well."
