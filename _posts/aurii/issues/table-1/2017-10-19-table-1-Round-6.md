Regalus slams the door to his store shut with a massive bang. He quickly drops the wooden doorbar into the slot and slumps slightly against the wall. 

"Nokri." he says without opening his eyes. "You're going to have to get outta town after this one." he pauses and his eyes open, though he's still looking down at the floorboard. "That's uh. Not cause I'm tell you to or anythin. Theanovene will deal with dopes like them-" he jabs a thumb in the direction of the chaos "given some time but you'll have to be out and away for that. Got anywhere you can travel to? Visit fam... Visit friends, or anything for work?" he finishes, looking up at the girl. The sheepish, worried look on his face speaks volumes.

"Damned! Where do you all keep coming from?!" The captain growls out as ZaRel pulls him from his blows against Tikur. He turns on a steel toed boot and slashes wide at the boy, only to hit empty air as the youth escaped his reach. To add insult to injury, as he steps forward to give chase an arrow hits his shoulder plate. The plate dents inward, cause the captain pain every time he moves his shoulder. He growls and spits in the wolf's general direction.

"To hell with this." He mutters. He runs around the side of Tikur, vaulting over what was once Nokri's stand to find himself in front of the door. He goes to pull the door open only to find it barred. He slams a gauntlet against the door in frustration. He grabs his blade with two hands and start to hack at the door hinges, hoping to destroy them before he is pulled back into the chaos behind him.

(ooc: We have an example of a side goal here. This is basically a sub conflict to the main one. It doesn't matter if he gets through the door or not at the end of the main conflict, but if he does it may make his victory easier. Side goals can take pretty much any form. They're a challenge you can attempt to defeat that will have some effect on the main conflict. You can direct dice at a side goal the same way you can a Named Enemy.)

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-10-20*

The shot hits as intended and the big man spits in Aldus’ direction. 

“Gonna need to spit a little higher than tha-” he’s cut short by zapping sensation tingling through his left arm and holding him still for just a second. The lightning bolt knocks him off balance , over backward onto the opposite side of the roof. But he quickly regains control of his limbs, and is able to stop himself from tumbling too far down and off the peaked roof onto the cobblestone below. 

He had checked for more archer’s - but not magic users. He crawls on all fours back up the roof, staying low he peers over the roof’s ridge. He spots the one who zapped him peering out from behind the corner for just a second before retracting out of sight. Aldus pulls his legs up underneath him in deep kneel and raises his bow up again this time holding it parallel with the roof, he pulls back and sucks in his breath holding it to steady his hand. Just as predicted the mage emerges again from his corner, hand outstretched, Aldus fires directly at that outstretched hand, piercing it directly through the palm. Aldus releases his breath with a huff. 

“Haven’t we taken down enough of you?!” by the way the fighting continues he takes that as a resounding “no”

Now he sees the captain again, this time trying to break down the door of the general store. *he must really want to get to her, doesn't exactly seem worth all the trouble to me* he thinks. He backs back down the roof - the side facing away from the fighting and sits down on the slant of the roof, he takes a few seconds to rifle around his belt pouch. His fingers close around a small glass vile and he produces a yellow tinged, syrup-like liquid. He grabs the cork with his teeth and pulls it out of the vial, then he spits the cork back into his belt pouch for recycling. He holds the vial in one hand while reaching around his shoulder with the other to pull another arrow from his quiver. He coats the tip of the arrow in the syrupy liquid and deposits the empty vial along with the cork.

The liquid is something made in his mentor's village, a slowing serum - non lethal. Although he’s only seen it work about half the time it is used, Aldus figures it worth a shot if it slows the captain down enough to buy the people inside a few extra seconds to find another way out and get away.

He returns to his former position and readies the coated arrow toward the captain. He pulls back hard but steadily holding his breath again. Aiming carefully at the same spot he hit the captain in before - figuring his armor to be weakened there - Aldus let’s fly again and releases his breath.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2017-10-23*

"Yeah." Nokri's response to Regalus was rather halfhearted. She was more concerned with other things than the future at the moment, seeing as whatever happened in the future would be decided now. He was being oddly worried for her and it set her on edge just as much as the sudden thud against the door hinge.

"I've got somewhere to go. Don't worry 'bout it, I've had a backup plan for ages." (OOC: Unreliable Expositor.) Her voice took on a slight accent similar to that of the soldier's outside now that it didn't matter what she said or how she said it. Regalus was a good enough guy who likely already knew her origin. And if he didn't before he sure did now. Despite what she said Nokri had absolutely nowhere to go, but if she started running now she could figure it out along the way.

"Need help with that?" she asked, referring to the gradually weakening door. She owed Regalus big time for this, that much was true. If not for his intervention he'd have a lovely new red stained wall out front of his shop the color of her blood. But Nokri never asked for his help and didn't feel particularly inclined to stay and pay back the favor. "You got a plan at all? Otherwise I'll just book it, no lookin' back. You can have whatever's left out front," she remarked, only partially in jest.

**ZaRel (Nick)** - *2017-10-23*

As the captain flees from ZaRel to attack the door he looks around briefly for some more information so that he can come up with some plan of action. *If that door gives way we may have a problem getting the girl out of here. Who knows how long that may take Ienzo to get over and start travelling.* Struggling to find something to do he is at a loss. *I don't see any strategy. The others are occupied so it's up to the archer and myself and I don't know how much help the archer will really be from afar.* ZaRel looks around and notices that most of the common folk in the market have backed away sufficiently from the combat ensuing leaving a large open space that all of the combatants are fighting within. *I guess I have no option at this point.* he thinks as he reaches into the neck hole of his shirt and grabs a small jagged purple stone attached to a leather strap around his neck in his fist, and while making sure nobody sees the stone, releases the energy stored inside.

The energy crackles out of the stone in large purple arcs into his small body. ZaRel falls to his knees with a single fist on the ground, the other still grasping the crackling purple stone. The stone's form fades away as the energy is released from it. Once the stone is completely gone ZaRel's small form is instantly replaced by the massive form of a Deep Purple dragon with a large frilled crest on each side of his head and a line of small spikes starting from the top of his spine down to the end of his tail. He beats his large leathery wings against the air, filling out his wings, and blowing a heavy gust across the battlefield (which is now primarily taken up by his massive form). With this gust of wind, several of the soldiers are knocked off of their feet and scuttle back in fear of the visage before them.

ZaRel swings his tail down onto one of the soldiers that fell from the gust and the soldier ceases moving. ZaRel then turns toward the man chopping at the door and bellows in a deep, loud voice that begins shaking the nearby buildings, "Leave this place now! You have caused enough trouble for us! I do not care what this girl has done, but I have become irritated by your persistence! You do not wish the wrath of a god come down upon you and yours, do you!?" As he finishes this shout a large tuft of purple smoke shoots out from the sides of ZaRel's mouth and floats up without being dissipated by the wind.

Once the mortal responds to ZaRel he asks, with the same bellow as the first time, "What is your name mortal?!" 

A column of smoke that is now protruding from this dragon that suddenly appeared in the middle of the market is drawing eyes from all parts of the city and a few lands shortly beyond.
