The Drecians make it to the center of the courtyard as you reach the observatory. They've slowed down, judging by their boot steps. A peek over your shoulder reveals they've sat down in the middle of the courtyard, now holding bottles of something. They look decidedly comfortable over there.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-11-16*

As soon as they are inside the observatory Aldus let's out a deep sigh of relief. He then realizes he's holding Nokris hand a little too tightly and releases it. He runs a hand through his hair nervously and looks about, “Come on, let's see if we can't find an exit in the other side”

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2017-11-16*

Inside the observatory smelled scholarly, like books and nerds. A scent Nokri wasn't particularly fond of. With her hand finally free, Nokri wiped it off on her shirt and took a few steps back. "*Thank* you," she muttered sarcastically to her two-time savior. "Yeah, there should be another exit somewhere. Stupid if a place this big doesn't have two doors." She hoped that the researchers that ran the place were too preoccupied to care about their presence and that they could pass through unimpeded. There was a star map pinned to the wall that briefly caught her interest as they walked by. The Drecan military unit previously used the stars and the sun and whatnot to guide them. Nokri wasn't a navigator but had been mandatory to pick up a few things, and in the moment she thought it might serve useful now that the city was too dangerous to stay in for a while.
