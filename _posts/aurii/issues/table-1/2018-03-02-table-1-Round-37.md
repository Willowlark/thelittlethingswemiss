**Bill** - *2018-03-02*

The young woman somehow manages to tumble with Nokri as Nokri 'bumps' into her. The two roll a few times before ending up on a heap in the ground. While Nokri stands, the strange looks at her now dusty white blouse and looks terribly forelorn. When Nokri offers her a hand up the girl looks the Drecian girl over. The girl's blue eyes dart to towards the wolf faunus running towards them, shouting "Nokri". 

She takes Nokri's hand immediately and pulls her self up. The woman takes a half step in front of Nokri and lets her knapsack slide around her front. She pulls a spell book from it and flips it open, point a hand forward at the approaching Aldus and Eliran.

"Stop! If this little girl is trying to get away from you you must leave her be! I won't see anyone else harassed like that!" the girl says with more bravado than you'd expect from someone with such soft features. You can tell she's determined her her statement, but she just doesn't have the features to be truly intimidating. 

Even so the lightning bolt that cracks to the ground not 5 feet in front of the boys more than makes up for it. She was able to mutter the spell in no more than second which only makes the manipulation of nature all the more impressive. Nokri is left a few feet behind the girl apparently defending her, while Aldus and Eliran are a good 30 feet from the young woman facing off with them.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-03-02*

Blue eyes. Bingo. But there was no time for elation, because *of course* Nokri wasn't the only one to spot her. Or maybe Nokri's sudden disappearance made them rightly suspicious. Either way, things were going to get rocky now that they were here.

This girl was amazing. Nokri had real panic in her eyes and held fast onto her hand and pulled her up, then prepared to run off with her. But instead she turns around and blasts them, leaving a nice scorch mark in the road. Nokri got the feeling she was gonna like this girl. "Watch out!" she squeaked. "My ex-boyfriend and his bunch is not friendly when mad... a-and they know how to fight... it might be better to run!" As the static in the air died down Nokri stood behind the girl like some frightened child and continued shakily to spit out "I thought he was the kindest, most gentlest man but as soon as we started dating he changed, he changed so much, and I tried to leave him but that only made him angrier and... oh this isn't good! I don't want you caught up in our trouble, I'm so sorry!"

While standing behind, Nokri tried to take a glance over the girl's shoulder at her book. Even if that wasn't the tome they were originally searching for, it would be worth a pretty penny on its own. She gently took hold of the girl's sleeve, as though urging her that they should escape fast.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-03-05*

Aldus stops short, stumbling slightly as the new small woman whips around and fires a bolt of electricity only a few feet in front, and directly in between him and Eliran Obviously a warning shot. She’s also taken a protective stance over Nokri, But why? Did she not just hit the woman with the full force of her tiny body, barreling her over? Aldus cocks his head, puzzled. This is obviously the woman they are looking for - Brown hair, blue eyes, traveling clothes, and evidently a mage of some talent. Why would she attack them? Further - why would she protect the person that just plowed into her?

When Nokri first squeaks out “Watch out” Aldus feels a wave a relief roll over him *Oh good, she's going to explain that we’re with her, and only trying to help* But that wave is quickly replaced with one of disappointment and dread. His ears droop as if he's being scolded. He feels his tail begin to move toward his legs. *Ex-boyfriend?! Is she talking about me? Who is she talking about? Is she serious right now…..*  

As Nokri recounts her “bad relationship” with who he can only imagine is supposed to be himself, it only gets worse. He feels his heart drop to his stomach frozen in place as this small woman who barely knows him paints him in a light he knows all too well. She’s talking about him the same way Aldus might speak of his father. His father - The man who’s disappointment and abuse spurred this entire departure from Wynne to begin with. He stares at Nokri, stunned. “How could she” he says too quietly for her to hear, she doesn't know this about him obviously and it’s not like she wouldn't have said those things otherwise. He was hoping after their little blow out she’d consider lightening her tone, but that hope has been extinguished now.

He can only run damage control now, he has to chose his next actions and words carefully. Try to defuse this situation as quickly as possible. He doesn’t want a rehash of the occurrence in the inn a few weeks ago. He slowly raises his hands in surrender, not making any sudden movements and bows his head slightly, ears still in a downward position. 

“Desii please, do not believe her words. I know you have no reason to listen to me but believe me when I say I would sooner throw myself from the cliffs of the nearest shore than be the man she has just described to you. My name is Aldus, and this is Eliran, the woman falsely accusing me of atrocities is Nokri. I assure you this is an act of hers. We were sent by Zaimar, he worries for you. He sent us to bring you home to straighten out whatever caused you to run away with his tome. Please know He is not angry with you. We also require your self, or rather, I require your help.”
