**Bill** - *2018-03-26*

"Wow, um, that's quite a generous offer." Desii says, nervously twisting her right foot against the floorboards. "I uh, well, you saw this morning that I have to worry about being followed by Zaimar, so I'd really just cause you more trouble." She says. She doesn't sound convinced by her own justification. She glances over to the bartender and takes a deep breath, that nervous energy flowing from her.

"I am going to Trisp though. I can help you find Crysalin too, if you help me with something else." she says somberly. The bartender walks into the back, almost as if on cue. "The bartender here, and his wife... I helped them out in the attack the other night. They showed me some hospitality, and they also told me their story."

"There have been plenty of attacks on this town in the past. The mountains are right there, and it is a border town. Eraia and Callora aren't usually at blows, but there are those with negative opinions of the other on either side. None to this level, the city watch here is quite skilled." Desii lays her hands on top of each other on the table, the upper one holding the lower. "During an attack years ago Dain and Saila lost their daughter. It was a violent attack and she was shopping near the point of attack."

"Dain and Saila don't think she was killed though. They, as any parent would, dove into the attacking force desperately trying to find their daughter. They swear the saw a man with Eraian regalia carrying Enera off. No one in town believes them. The whole town things Dain and Saila are just clinging to any fanciful story they can, rather than accept Enera's death." Desii says quietly. You can see in her eyes that she believe Dain and Saila.

"It makes sense, if only for one detail. Enera was a studying light mage. She was self taught but was doing wonderfully, from what I can tell. She was young enough at the time that if she was taken away, she could be convinced everything was fine." Desii finishes. "I said I'd look for her when I go into Eraia. Dain and Saila can't get across the border, but I was going to find a way somehow to begin with. If you help me look for her in Trisp, I'd be able to help you find Crysalin." Desii's eyes are passionate, you can see how much she's taken to this quest. She looks back and forth between you, pressuring you to answer with that same passion.

Nokri bumbles down the block, avoiding the heavier traffic areas. "Heavier traffic" is more of a joke than anything, in the wake of the attack no one seems to be outside to begin with. 

Nokri feels a sudden tug on her left arm, yanking her into a side alley. A hand comes up to her mouth and the hand that pulled her in wraps around her waist, holding her arms to her torso. Twisting your head you can see that a man in a white cloak has pulled you into the alley.

"You, little miss, are of Drecian origin. And that makes you a sinner." He says into your ear. "I have use for you, so you may serve Lylalel even in sin." With that he slams you face first onto the ground, knocking the wind out of you while still holding your hands behind your back. He pulls out rope, quickly tying your wrists while you regain your breath. Just as you feel able to let out a cry for help, he stuffs a rag in your mouth making you feel uncomfortably like a suckling pig.

Suddenly both you and your captor hear a gasp. A middle aged woman with long brown hair and blue eyes is at the far end of the alley. Rather than fear, her face boils over with rage. "Not again!" she cries even as the man quickly tosses a dagger in her direction. She shields herself with her shopping bags as the man throws you over his shoulder and bolts. 

He runs with you through silent streets, not a soul to condemn his actions in sight. He has a horse tied on the east end of town, which he drops you on before climbing up himself. As you realize he's getting away with this, you see that same woman running up the street, panting and heaving. You can see her collapse to her knees as the man cracks the reins, the horse starting into a gallop.

(ooc: time skip, will occur later for the other half of the table)

You spend you time being kidnapped having your head bumped into a horse's ass and smelling the same ass. It's terribly unpleasant. The man says nothing on the trip. Eventually you reach the foot of the mountains and find yourself at a small cave in the hillside. The man ties off his horse to a tree and throws you back over his shoulder, heading into the cave. 

As you go deeper into the cave you begin to hear voices. It's not long before the cave opens up to massive hall. You enter from a second level entrance of sorts, to your left and right are crude staircases leading down to the expansive main floor. All across the main floor are what must be bandits. There's little doubt, given their smell and appearance. The man drops you in front of him, the sound of you losing your breath yet again call the room to attention. They don't look happy seeing the man either, but quiet down as he looks over the room.

**Eliran (Halim)** - *2018-03-26*

Eliran listens closely to Desi, and an observant person would notice how he tenses up at the mention of Eblia. He had always wanted to return and see what was left of his grandfather's homeland, and this would provide a good excuse. 

Listening to the other ingredients, Eliran felt uncertain about giving somebody berserker juice, but what did he know about potions? 

After hearing Desi's request Eliran almost gave short laugh, it was ironic. They decided to go looking for a girl to bring her home, only to be asked by said girl to find another girl and bring her home.
Seeing Desi's look he realized he probably shouldn't mention the humor in the situation until a more opportune time. 
"A girl kidnapped?" Eliran asked, "how could we say no." He looked to Aldus, then back to Desi, "like you, we are already on our way into Eraia, plus our original intention was to try and find somebody en route to begin with" he looked a bit apologetic "sorry about that again." 

Eliran sat back in his chair, thinking about it a little more, "still... if what you say is true, we're gonna have to be really careful. If we're trying to free the girl from Eraian soldiers, we might end up being wanted criminals in a country of religious fanatics..."

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-03-27*

With barely anyone in her path, Nokri was quite enjoying her tipsy stroll. The clouds in the sky were billowing like pillows and she was pleased once again to be free. She could go anywhere and do anything all by herself with nothing holding her back. It was just like when she became a deserter - her possibilities were nearly endless.

*Maybe there's a hick village here in the boonies out here in need of a doctor and I can get some reputation there,* she considered. Even if the current town was in shambles, one of the surrounding farms would surely have room to spare for a night or two for such a sweet angel like Nokri. She started rehearsing in her head exactly what she could say to find decent accommodations in the area, and what backstory would fit best.

Swaying to and fro, Nokri took slightly too wide of a step and promptly lost balance. Something moved to her left. Rather than helping her stand upright, as Nokri assumed would happen, the shadow jerked harshly on her arm and pulled her down. Had she been sober things may have turned out differently, but at present Nokri could barely perceive what was happening in real time. It was like a blur, and the undesirable voice that made her ears itch was incomprehensible. Given the dirty rag in her mouth that tasted unwashed and sweaty, though, she had a fair assumption about what was going on. Nokri kicked her legs and aimed a few blows at her assailant, but given she was never a fighter the blows would only leave a light bruise or two at best.

A loud shout caused her to flinch, and Nokri shut her eyes as she continued to thrash. Soon enough though she was picked up and whisked away via horseback. It wasn't Nokri's preferred way of riding. Not in the least. But one gets used to the smell in time, especially if it was something you had to smell every day in the past. Nokri figured this kidnapping had to do with her Drecan appearance - though whether this person was pro-Drecan or against them she wasn't sure - and wondered if she could get out of it by convincing the captor she wasn't Drecan. Maybe some rural accent would do the trick. There wasn't much use struggling on the horse though, and falling off and being trampled by the animal would be less pleasant than the current predicament, so Nokri continued to bear it.

Looking around was basically impossible when they reached the supposed destination. Since the majority of the ride was spent looking down, Nokri also had very little ideas about where they could possibly be. Once taken inside, it took a short minute for Nokri's eyes to adjust. A hastily carved base inside of a cave. *How original.* The feel of this interior gave off a culty vibe, and the people within looked cliquey. Upon being unceremoniously dropped to the ground, she let out a pitiful "oof" that was audible over the gag. Nokri curled up cautiously, staying horizontal to the ground but unreservedly scanning what was visible of the room. She looked blankly up at whoever had taken her with narrowed eyes, any trace of drunkenness now long gone from her system.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-03-29*

Aldus listens carefully to Desii’s story, it’s the least he can do after all the time she spent looking through that book for ways to help him. The look on Desii’s face combined with the expression of the kidnapped girls father tugs heavily on his heart strings. 

“I can see the conviction in both of you” he turns his attention briefly to Dain “You must love and miss her dearly, you are a good father” he says before turning back to address both of them “Of course we will help look for her.” He tries not to consider the fact that the girl may be fully assimilated by know - depending on the terms of her capture. He wonders briefly if his own father misses him at all before giving himself a resounding *no*. 

“But for tonight we should turn in, get rooms and rest up. We can set out to Trisp in the morning.” Aldus stand up and looks toward the bar for the first time in about an hour. He notes that Nokri is no longer there, just an empty glass left in the place she was sitting. He doesn't feel concerned though *she’s always implying she doesn't need me around, guess she set out to go prove it.*
