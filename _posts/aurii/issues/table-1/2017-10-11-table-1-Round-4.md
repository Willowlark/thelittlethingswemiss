**Round 4**

As the Wynnite wolf describes what remedies he's tried in the past Nokri recalls reading about a particularly odd herbal remedy. It's more of a legend than a recipe really. The recipe comes from stories of old, stories of a potion that elder laguz would take that revitalized their beast form. Even laguz nearing a century in age could run wild with the pack like they were just teenagers, after but a single drink of the recipe. Legend states it can cure a laguz's wild form of any wound, and ailment, and maybe even bring the form for the Wynnite before her. 

That said, this potion became a legend for one particular reason; the key ingredient is a herb called *Fyarala*, native only to the western coast of the mainland. No one can say why it grows there, but expeditions to find it elsewhere have never bore fruit. The ashen green herb is highlighted by darker speckling on the underside of it's leaves. Ever since Eraia came into it's own as a nation no one has been able to get to the plant; Eraians themselves unwilling to retrieve it as 'preventing Lylalel's light from returning to her is heretical'. While the potion follows a surprisingly modern formula, the difficulty of getting the keep ingredient and admittedly limited user base has left the potion naught but a footnote in an advanced potion crafting handbook.

A group of Drecian soldiers walk through the crowded market. They stand out like a sore thumb, despite their jovial attitudes given their complexion and full armor. Any Theanovian local would recognize them as a caravan guard; waiting for their wagons to be loaded before heading back to their camp. While obnoxious, they don't seem intend on causing trouble for anyone the market. 

The first man in the group, by some form of luck, looks over to see the dwindling crowd around Nokri's stand and decides it's a good chance to visit what must be a normally busy stall. He waves his companions along, and they step up to the shop.

"Hello! We fine working men would love to sample some of..." he trails off as he tries to figure out just what the bottles on the counter actually are. "Whatever it is you sell here!" He says, giving up on his attempt and flashing a rather winning smile at the shopkeeper. His smile fades however, getting a good look at Nokri. 

"Oi. You're Drecian." He says, his tone flat and accusatory. "You a deserter? You must be. Only military personnel on the mainland." Behind him, his allies slowly move a hand to the hilts of their weapons. "Can't have no deserters in Lord Dryn's army. I think you'll be coming with us." The captain of the squad says. He places his arm on the hilt of his sword. "Don't make this ugly."

(ooc: Each of you can see this occurance; only Nokri, Tikur, and Aldus heard the man's speech. If you make to engage to deal with the *threat* these soldiers pose (Specifically they are *trying to capture Nokri*), remember to describe your actions in detail. The more details, the more dice you're awarded against the threat. If you'd like to note what aspect you're trying to invoke, you can note it in an ooc comment like this. I have final say of which aspect is most related to the actions you take however (otherwise no one would ever roll against their weaknesses lol). 

There is no defined number of enemies. If you want to engage one, there's one for you to engage. They are mooks, there are as many as needed for the action to take place. The *Captain* is a 'named' foe; Unlike mooks he gets to roll dice and has hit points.

This is going to be the first combat encounter! That said, just as much as you have no idea what to do, I don't either. It's a learning curve for all of us. We'll take it slow, ask any questions you have, and we'll sort it out as we go.)

Conflict: Dreca doesn't tolerate deserters; You're coming with us!

**ZaRel (Nick)** - *2017-10-12*

As ZaRel and Ienzo are heading back to the general store, ZaRel notices a group of men reaching for their swords and moving towards the potion shop keeper. Not being one to jump head-first into a fight ZaRel tries to ignore the commotion and head into the general store, *Not my people, not my problem*. However, he glances over at Ienzo, who looks as if he is about to spring into action, and decides that his guide would have a better chance of surviving this fight if he has some support.

ZaRel grabs Ienzo's arm and says, "Ienzo, I have an idea, you are going to have to trust me. I think we can handle these guys if we work together. I'm not much of a fighter, but keep an ear out for my instructions." ZaRel looks around, trying to find a vantage point he can easily reach.

He notices that near the top of the general store's walls some of the stone has crumbled away leaving a solid hand hold that he can use to access the roof. As soon as he finishes speaking to Ienzo he jumps up onto his shoulders and then uses him as a base to reach that worn away portion of the wall. ZaRel manages to grab the break in the stone and flip himself up and onto the roof (ooc: Agile Acrobat). His actions draw the attention of the crowd but it seems that the soldiers are more interested in the potion shop girl than their surroundings. *This can work in our favor*, ZaRel thinks to himself with a grin.

As he is taking in the information of this impromptu battlefield he notices two wolf laguz have also noticed the commotion and look as though they are about to jump into the fray as well. *So many people trying to get into others' business. I suppose their support does help us to a degree. If we could take out their leader we could break their morale and have an easier chance of forcing them to disperse. But how can I tell which one is their leader though!*

ZaRel shouts to Ienzo, "Try to keep that group of soldiers away from the potion girl! I'll try to convince the wolves to attack the guy near them!" ZaRel then looks to the wolf laguz, "Hey Laguz! Listen to me if you truly want to help that girl! Focus your attack on the man nearest to the potion girl, the large fellow will try to keep the rest of the soldiers off your backs!" (ooc: Meticulous Strategist)

Attack: 1
Defense: 1

**Tikur (Kurtis)** - *2017-10-12*

Tikur was about to respond to the shopkeeper when he noticed the guards approach and seem to want to do business.  When their attitude soured it became clear that they were going to start something whether or not she went with them.  When he spotted someone on the roof shouting a strategy to keep the shopkeeper safe.  He acknowledged the figure "alright! Time we had some fun anyway!" He shouts back up, whole he's doing that he unhooked his spell book from his waist and casts  Cage of Fearsome Lightning around the leader of the guards so that hopefully he'll rethink his course of action.  "Aldus, you ready for some fun?" He chuckles.  "Hopefully this all turns out well..."

**Heroth** - *2017-10-12*

As Ewan rested in the inn, he heard people near the front door start to murmur and look out the window. As he got up to check what was going on, the spirit Knoll dashed under the tables of the inn twords the entrance and through the wall into a puff of smoke. Ewan became concerned and hurried over to look outside, only too see a group of Drecian soldiers wearing Dryn's banner begin to reach for their weapons. 
Fury boiled Ewans blood as he kicked the inn door open. He dashed out and jumped into the street throwing back his cloak, grabbed his Necronomicon tome, and placed it down in front of him with his right hand. Dangling around Ewan's neck was a string of bones and with his left hand he pulled one off. A soldier began rushing at the mage who had casted a spell on their captain, but as he raised his sword Ewan chucked the bone at his helmet and the guard stopped in his tracks. It fell at his feet and the soilder looked down at the bone confused. The bone began to vibrate and melt into the earth while a black sludge began to bubble from beneath the cracks in the ground. The soilder turned to run away, but in that moment two undead hands of the zombie Murphy reached out of the ground and pulled the soldier down. The soldier tried to crawl away, but Murphy used the soldier's weight for leverage as he dug, clawed, and bit the solder until he pulled himself out of the ground (ooc:Murphy no!). Murphy grabbed the now dismembered sodier's body and flung it at the other guards, letting out a deep goulish snarling breath that was so cold it could be seen. The moan was an undead war cry, and he ready to fight.

**Ienzo (john g)** - *2017-10-13*

As Ienzo see the soldiers moving twards the potion stand reading their blades he decides he may have to step in. Before he knows it his new found dragon companion used him as a springboard to reach the roof of the general store, before he disappeared from sight Ienzo can hear him say  "Try to keep that group of soldiers away from the potion girl! I'll try to convince the wolves to attack the guy near them!". Putting on his best currious face he decides to confront the soldiers head on. 
  " Why hello everyone, what did my little potion making friend here do that made you all so angry with her that you would draw your weapons? It cant be the potion she gave you didn't work mine worked fine." he says as he hides the potion she gave her so she cant see it.
  " This little witch here is a deserter, were from the Drecian army if you cant tell and theres not allowed to be any deserters in our army. This witch is comming with us!" the closest soldier starts to reach for the potion girl.

Ienzo quickly grabs the soldiers arm as he reaches it out. "Now lets not get hasty lets all calm down, I have dealt with your kind before. If this girl left Drecia it was her choice, and we have to respect that choice here if you don't like that were gonna have a problem." Ienzo whole pressence goes from calm to menacing quickly.
 "I dont think you know what your getting yourself into , we out number you and you dont seem to have a weapon with you it would be a slaughter if you wanted to try and stop us..." As he goes to finish his sentance Ienzo squeezes real hard and breaks the soldiers arm.(ooc: I dont need a weapon, I'm my own weapon.) With the soldiers cry in pain the others draw there weapons. one of them even gets ready to charge Ienzo with his sword. 
Ienzo waits as the seccond soldier begins to charge at him. As if he knew the perfect time Ienzo grabs the swords blade between both his hands and with all his might he twist the blade with his hands and the blade cracks into two pieces. "Now do we have to keep doing this or you gonna leave my little friend here alone?" Ienzo says taking off his cloak to reveal his hidden musscles(ooc: I dont need a weapon, I'm my own weapon and you need patience to catch a fish). He begins to think to himself i hope ZaRel can get the others to fight incase this decides to go south.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2017-10-15*

“Hmmm. I’m afraid I don’t know anyone who might be familiar with this sort of thing,” Nokri stated in response to the lagul’s question. Though something did nag her in the back of her mind. Something, somewhere in one of her parents’ books? Ugh, she hated those books so much, but it was part of her *learning curriculum* to study each and every one of them. 

“There might b…” Nokri trailed off mid-sentence, losing her train of thought as a group of people caught her eye. Drecan soldiers, ambling around the market. She shifted to the side a bit, into the shade, hoping to go unnoticed behind her customers but it was too little too late. Here came the Drecan party. A nervous smile and meager “welcome” greeted them at the potion table. For a hot minute Nokri thought maybe she could get away with just selling them some wares, but obviously that wasn’t going to cut it. The captain noticed something was off and began running his mouth.

“Drecan? Me? Please, sir. I’ve lived i-“ 
Obviously they recognized her as a Drecan, despite attempts to play it off.
“I’m not-“ “I couldn’t possib-“
Any attempts to get a word in edgewise were ignored, and the boisterously loud voice of the captain was drawing plenty of interested looks from nosy passerby.

Taking a step back, Nokri knew this would probably end in bloodshed. Ignoring the customer still standing by, she turned to flee but was caught by the hair by one of the soldiers. As they were still on opposite sides of the stall, soldiers started coming around either side to surround her. Nokri rammed her side into one of the crates, sending several bottles on top crashing to the ground in hopes that the glass shards now covering the ground would serve as a deterrent. But the glass was easily crushed under heavy boots and the action only served to make everything smelly.

Then things got worse. Nokri hadn’t noticed, but her customers were fighting back. Why? She had no idea. But she knew she’d probably never sell at that market again. Shouts and punches flew everywhere, and she was fairly certain someone got whacked in the head with a severed arm. She didn’t have the strength to escape from her captor despite multiple poorly-aimed kicks to the shins and a whole lot of struggling, but the instant she felt his grip slacken Nokri jumped away with all her might and ran towards the side of the general store, trying to escape from the commotion.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-10-15*

Aldus and the stall keeper were continuing their conversation when quite the imposing figure saddled up to the stall demanding “free samples”. As if that wasn't enough he then began threatening the blonde shop keeper with -essentially- kidnapping? Because she’s Drecian, and a supposed “deserter”?

“What the hell-” Aldus says to himself with a snarl, letting one of his pointed canine teeth show He has the passing thought that perhaps he should just not get involved. But damnit this is bullshit, the stall keeper didn't do anything wrong, and there are obvious factors this jerk isn’t even considering! He rocks back on his heels and turns, taking a quick survey of what's around him to take advantage of. His eyes dart around his surrounding in a surveying manner. Nearby there is  pile of crates that are stacked up against a wall of an adjacent establishment, making an almost perfect set of wide stairs up the roof above. Good - better to have the high ground. 

At this point many people have stopped to see what all the fuss is about, which is good for Aldus. He makes easy work of weaving through the crowd and to the makeshift staircase of crates.  He springs from one crate to the next with an exaggerated bend and squat of each alternating leg. In a matter of seconds he reaches the top of the roof. He positions himself with his right leg bent and his left leg straight to compensate for the slant of the roof under him. He pulls his oak bow from his shoulder where it has been resting and quickly pulls and nocks an arrow from his quiver. He pulls back, aiming for the space between the collarbone and shoulder of the one who he heard threaten the stall keeper directly and fires.

Not waiting to see if the shot lands Aldus immediately turns his attention to one of the other seemingly lesser soldiers. Extracting another arrow from his quiver he takes aim again this time at the soldier’s left ankle. Firing true, his arrow sails through the air making easy work of the soldier's boot, it connects solidly with it's intended target. The soldier falls to his knees and then to the side, grabbing at his now debilitated ankle. Aldus lowers his bow to assess the damage, and realises that others - the same people that were at the stall before - have joined in to defend the stall keeper as well. He cracks a toothy grin at the realization.
