**Bill** - *2018-03-05*

The young woman continues to glare at Aldus as he begins to explain himself, right up until he mentions begin sent by Zaimar. Her eyes flutter and she starts in a brief panic. She whirls around with her closed book, smacking Nokri up side the head and knocking the girl to the ground. 

"So that's his game is it, use children to get to me? Could he be more twisted?" She says, running down the alley she originally headed towards. She sprints to the next corner, her tome clutched tightly to her chest, before turning the corner to the left. She stumbles slightly as she does, knocking over some barrels that roll into the street, conveniently making pursuit a little more difficult. With Aldus's Niassankari hearing he can hear the girl shout 'sorry' as she runs. 

```
Side goal: Catch up!
Target: 6
Pool: 4
```

(ooc: This is not a conflict, just a side goal. Think of it as a one/two round encounter. I'm going to award dice for your efforts chasing the girl, and after enough successes you'll catch up. The difficulty will still be whichever approach your actions is closest to. There's no damage to be had, though you could lose her if you take *too* long.)

**Eliran (Halim)** - *2018-03-05*

The bolt of lightning lashing out behind him surprised Eliran, "Christ!" he exclaimed in surprise jumping forward a bit before looking back at where it struck. Looking back at the young girl, he raised his hands in the universal "I'm innocent" pose. Continuing to move forward, Eliran took his steps slowly and carefully, as if approaching a dangerous animal. "Now Miss, theres no need to get excited... I just wanted to see if you were ok after that fall." he said slowly, "I'm not chasing down Nokri and I could care less if she ditched our quest, because that means she doesn't get any of the reward, or the prize money I was thinking of sharing if we made it too Eraia.." he called out, emphasizing the parts about the reward and prize money.  

Annnnnnddd she's gone. Eliran sighed, why do people always run, and why did Aldus have to be so pure as to think that the girl who ran away from the Sage would want to go back. Shrugging, Eliran gave chase, following the girl and easily vaulting over the barrels as they go past. He was experienced in running away due to some issues in his less savory past, which meant he knew how to give chase as well.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-03-08*

Desii’s reaction at the mention of Zaimar’s name clearly indicates that he shouldn’t have mentioned that detail. In the rush to clear his name he had forgotten to consider that Desii probably wouldn’t want to run back home after so much effort to run away. Her comment about them being children catches him off guard, *Children? How old can she be?* She’s quite small and Aldus can't imagine her being much older than the three of them. But before he can even form the question she's off, heading the way she was going when Nokri decided to tackle her. 

Aldus glares at Nokri “Ancestors Nokri, ever heard of being subtle?! Ugh!” he doesn’t wait for her to respond and pushes of in Desii’s direction, a few feet behind Eliran. He doesn’t expect Nokri to follow and in that moment he doesn’t care if he ever sees her small scowling face ever again. 

The woman doesn't seem very coordinated, just as Zaimar had said. The observation is solidified when he hears a crash and then an apology, obviously to an unexpecting townsperson. 

He considers the irony in this situation. If he was like the rest of his kind this chase would have been over before it even started. Of course if he was like the rest of his people he wouldn't even be here, chasing some small overly ambitious mage through a scorched town. He sighs, which comes out as more of a grunt with the force of his footfalls. At the very least, the path of destruction left in her wake should leave it easy to track her.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-03-08*

"See how they li-" Nokri was saying as the bag hit her squarely in the jaw. She had the most offended look on her face as she jumped up in hot pursuit of the girl. Obviously she was not alone in this action.

"Ex*cuse* me? Subtlety? I've been the most subtle of us all. Who exactly spilled all the beans here?" she spat. "And reward? Pah. Having the sage fix Aldus's little *problem* doesn't put food in my stomach."

She was so busy shaking her head and ridiculing the two that her reaction to the tipped barrels was delayed. Nokri began to slow down but tripped over one anyway, doing a vaguely impressive somersault before getting conked in the head with another barrel. *This is fantastic* she thought bitterly.
