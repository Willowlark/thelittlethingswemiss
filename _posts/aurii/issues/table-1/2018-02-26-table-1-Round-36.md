**Bill** - *2018-02-26*

Tamus looks downtrodden for a moment as you ask your questions before visably sighing. He motions to the bench he was resting on before then sits opposite it, on the rim of the knee wall around the monument. 

"The shorter answer first" he says to Eliran, "is that this isn't Eraia invading with soldiers. If it was, we'd all be bowing our heads in pray about now." he says dryly. "Some people here believe it is though, especially the Kelit parents. I wouldn't listen to them too closely though, ever since their daughter disappeared a few years back they've been swearing up and down Eraia was behind it." He seems to catch himself for a second. "It was a terrible tragedy for the town of course." he adds sheepishly. 

"Lets see, as for what happened." he transitions, rolling his head and cracking his neck in the process. "We're not terribly sure. This damage was done two nights ago. Most people were asleep when this group rolled into town. They injured all of the night watch as they entered and started outright pillaging the place. Thankfully we didn't lose anyone, though almost everyone in town has an injury to show from the raid. It's not terribly surprising they had that in mind though. My theory is the lot of them are more arsonist than thieves. They had a fire mage with them, a skilled one at that. That was the cause of most of the damage we had."

"Anyway, lots of possessions were stolen, lots of homes have fire damage, and no one was able to see the faces of men and women who did this. The Kelits said the fire mage must be Eraian, because the mage wore white, but that's a big generalization. What are the odds some random person wearing white is a fire mage?" he shrugs. "I was in the thick of things though, let me tell you. Right from the start of the raid I was outside, because I like the stars, and..."

As Tamus continues his story, over his shoulder you can see a young woman with short brown hair walking into the courtyard. She has on a white blouse and wears a hip cape around her waist. She's checking a piece of paper for directions, looking this way and that. She has a leather knapsack slung over her shoulder. She heads down a side street as Tamus finishes his story about he saved the mayor, Frin, from getting an axe to the head.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-03-01*

Nokri had little interest in Tamus's story once he started rambling. She picked out the interesting tidbits, such as the Kelit family's daughter and the reason behind the damage, but then her attention was drawn to a pigeon on the ground that was infinitely more interesting than his highly exaggerated story.

The pigeon wandered to the edge of the courtyard and flew away as some chick entered. Short brown hair with a fashionable hip cape. The description sounded familiar. Nokri peered at Aldus and Eliran to see if they had noticed. She was itching to go up to the girl first and started backing away from the group. "Please excuse me, I have a very urgent need for the rest room," she stammered, more to dismiss herself from Tamus than the other two. If they weren't talking with somebody she would have just left without a word.

Nokri hurriedly ran around the courtyard and down the same alley, trying to get out of Eliran and Aldus's sight while still making a path towards the girl. As the girl's head was down Nokri ran full speed into her knapsack, trying to knock both of them over.  "Oh my goodness, I am *so* sorry!" she exclaimed. "Are you okay? Are you hurt? I was trying to get away from someone and wasn't watching where I was going." Nokri offered a helping hang, trying to catch sight of the girl's eye color to help discern her identity.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-03-01*

Adlus scratches the stubble on his chin as the man gives his personal account of what occurred. He’s relieved to find out no one was lost but puzzled as to what type of person or group would have caused this. As the man continues Aldus’s eyes survey around the courtyard, taking in his surroundings and the people about. He scans over the few people milling about as well as a woman in a white top and brown hair…. *No it can't be… could she be invol-* before his mind can complete the thought Nokri is running past him, straight toward the woman. *She’s gonna run straight into-* His mouth drops open as Nokri collides with the woman. “NOKRI!” He exclaims. “Im sorry sir I've gotta deal with something…” he tells the man while backpedaling then turns on his heel and hurries to catch up with Nokri and a woman matching a certain description.

**Eliran (Halim)** - *2018-03-01*

Eliran knew an exaggerated tale when he heard one, and as soon as Tamus started telling of his own exploits, he began to lose interest. 
What he didn't lose interest in were his surroundings, while Tamus had explained away the towns arsonist assault, Eliran continued to look at the damage and the people around the town center. When the young lady appeared, he kept an eye on her, wondering how to dodge the conversation and hold her down for a minute, however the Nokri seemed to be ahead of him with her "Urgent need for the rest room". It was a pretty lame excuse, but apparently, their story teller was lamer.

Still, Eliran didn't quite trust Nokri and her tendency to lie extremely poorly, and he really wanted to get away from Tamus's story (Seriously how much can a guy toot his own horn) so he offered his own reason as he slowly side stepped around and away from the group, "Sorry Tamus, Aldus here is going to have to listen to the rest of your story, because I'm going to go find us a place to stay".  And Eliran was off. Unlike Nokri, Eliran just went straight down the side street acting as if he was looking for a store or something; which he was as well, cause the did actually need somewhere to stay.

As he noticed Nokri's collision, Eliran, who had clearly left a bit before Aldus, rushes over to the two ladies..? he wasn't sure if Nokri deserved the title. women, sure, female? yes. Lady? a mental shrug was in order. "Are you two alright?" He asks concerned.
