**Bill** - *2017-12-21*

Despite the rather over the top reaction to their intrusion, Orar looks to Lac. "Do we really bother taking them with us? We can find him without these two and they really don't sound involved..." he says with a glance at Aldus and Nokri. Lac only snorts.

"Did you really get into organized crime thinking you'd never inconvenience someone Orar?" Lac says. "I told you I ain't taking the risk they are involved and are trying to play us." he turns specifically to Aldus and Nokri. "And that goes double for you, I don't really care what your story is you're coming with us. Boys?"

At his command the rest of the men in the room approach the two of them. Lac himself walks up and pulls Nokri up, throwing her over his shoulder. Surprsingly, he does delicately, making sure she wouldn't have to support her own weight in the transition. The other men motion of Aldus to come along after Lac, while Orar simple shakes his head with a hand over his face.

**Eliran (Halim)** - *2017-12-23*

_Well shit, now I've gotten them involved..._  Eliran thought, wondering what he should do. If they just go with them and continue to play along, the two strangers might be able to get off scott free, or they could give away his position to escape now. Still...  knowing the gangs reputation he couldn't help but assume the worse would happen to them, even if Orar seems like a bro.  Sighing to himself, he knew what he to do. Looking through a crack in the armoire door, Eliran picked his target, the nearest Mook, and burst out of the closet, attacking him with the short blade, aiming to kill with a slash to the mans throat.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2017-12-24*

Nokri stiffened when Aldus came over, but bore it through gritted teeth. “Thanks, dear,” she said, doing her best to sound sincere and hating every moment of it. Aldus could get an earful about this later, once their guests finally left. Much to her disappointment though they didn’t go away. 

Hearing their new decision to take them along, Nokri pouted, and the moment she was picked up she decided to spill the beans. She rolled her eyes and opened her mouth to tell the two hooligans that their target was in the closet. Before she could finish getting a word out though, the closet’s occupant burst out with guns blazing. “*Hey!* Watch it!” Nokri had had enough of violence and was none too keen of being even more injured.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-25*

Seeing these brutes man handle Nokri so disrespectfully makes one corner of  his mouth twitch up in disgust.

“Well, can't say we didn't try” he says with a shrug as Eliran springs out of the armoire. He drops his bow off his shoulder and into his left hand while simultaneously plucking an arrow from his quiver and notching it faster than either the brutes or their lackeys can react. He fires an arrow into the wall just above Lac’s head and then steps forward and kicks out with his left foot into Lac’s shin in an effort to make him lose his grasp on Nokri long enough to pull her back behind him. 

He chuckles at the cracked plaster on the wall, thinking how Nokri can add that to the list of things to yell at him for later, when they're done with this.
