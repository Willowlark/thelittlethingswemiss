**Bill** - *2018-01-29*

Your room is awoken once during the evening, as fireworks and cheers echo from outside. The channels and canals running throughout the city streets have a huge flush of water flowing through them, all coming from the north side of town. The water flows like a rapid, snaking it's way through the city in a beautiful flow. Children reach their hands into the water laughing and couples kiss in the spray of the water. The many bonfires you saw in the city are snuffed out as the water hits them, slowly darkening the city systematically as the water hits every canal. Soon the lights of the festival are all gone and only personal lights remain as people begin to work their way home.

The first thing you notice in the morning is that the bed was not that comfortable. Second, as you glance out the balcony, the festival is being taken down outside. Work crews tear down tents and stalls while children run about cleaning up garbage rather than going to school. Despite what seems like half the town working on the task at hand you can easily see across the fair grounds. You can't see a single man in the uniform of the men last night, which will let you travel the city freely.

You don't have much difficulty retracing your steps from last night. The original inn is continues to be quite nice looking, it's cozy decor and warm feeling still there after the festival. As you head in, the balding man sweeping the floor turns to you and gets a sour look.

"Oi, you two!" he says, looking at Aldus and Nokri. "You think you could manage to not get in a fight in one of my rooms? I don't run a dive here!" He pauses, nodding to Eliran before turning back to the two. "...What are you doing back here? After that trouble upstairs I'd expect you'd have left the city at daybreak." he looks questioningly.

Eliran raised a hand to calm the Inn Owner, "Look normally we would have been gone as soon as the gates opened, but we wanted to check in on your daughter, is that asshole from the past week still harassing her? Is she ok?" he looked around. "We heard something from one of the goons yesterday that made us worried."

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-02-01*

The instant they walked into the inn, Nokri had her good girl game face on. She coyly walked up to the inn owner as though regretful for what happened. "We're quite sorry about the room sir, I've no idea how this mess came to be. As you can see we were quite dinged up by it," she stated, motioning towards Aldus and her cut-up shoulder, which wasn't from last night's battle, but the inn keeper didn't need to know that. Assuming payment for the room would be fully taken care of, Nokri shot a glance at Eliran and retreated a few steps back to let him do what he needed.
