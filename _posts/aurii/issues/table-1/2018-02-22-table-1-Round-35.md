**Bill** - *2018-02-22*

It's a few weeks time before you reach Miyashire. The route you received from Zaimar is effectively the main trade route across the Alliance. It's fairly busy and you're able to travel with some of the caravans for a few days at a time before the caravan stops at the kingdom you're passing through. It makes for leisurely travel with little to worry over. The war doesn't affect many people up here and it shows. 

The caravans dwindle out about two thirds of the way through your trip. Most head north to the kingdom of Callora and it's capital Etrina. While it's a bit quieter the trip is no more difficult. The only oddity is you don't see anyone coming from Miyashire as you approach the town. 

You can see why as you crest the hill to the town's location. It's midday as you arrive and the hot weather is more akin to the recently passed summer than the fall. The town is small, spacious and bordered by farmlands. Most of it's buildings are wood, placed in a haphazard block arrangement that leaves plenty of space around each building but a few central walkways through the town. 

Most prominent as you approach are the damage that have been done to the town. Plenty of the crops in the field are snapped and broken, while there are both burn marks and straight up damage to the buildings. Half a dozen roofs are caved in and plenty of walls have holes in the them. What people you do see in the town look miserable, shuffling about on errands or trying to fix something broken. All in all, the town looks like it's been under some kind of siege.

You aren't bothered on your way to the center of town. A small grassy park decorates it, with a damaged statue of a young woman as it's centerpiece. The woman, before being pulled down and broken, was garbed in robes and was outstretching an arm with a smile on her face. There are a few people in the square. A man who looks terribly down on his luck is sleeping on a bench. A young woman is carrying a full bag from one store across the square to where ever she may be heading. She has a young boy in tow. A middle aged woman looks over the statue, dressed in mild finery. She looks over the statue with a shake of her head and writes some things down on a scroll.

he young woman with her son don't bat an eye at you as they disappear down a street. The older woman turns around to see the three of you after a moment. At first she seems surprised to see you, looking left and right. Quickly she catches herself and adjusts her waistcoat as a cover. She takes a first step towards you, putting a smile on her face. 

The smile fractures quickly, her lip quivering and brows showing that something is upsetting her. She turns to the side and walks away with her head down. The man you thought was asleep on the bench suddenly stirs, coming to his feet. He has a slight limp but approaches you with a halfhearted smile. 

"Don't mind poor Frin. She'd love to greet you herself, but it's hard given the current state of affairs." the man says. "I'm Tamus. I'm not much, but I represent Miyashire's welcoming presence, at least right now." he smiles wryly. "I"m already used to things looking like shit, unlike the rest of town." 

"I'll answer any questions I can for you, or leave you be if you'd like." He then jokes, "Can show you a restaurant that's still operating, for the small fee of a meal." and chuckles to himself.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-02-26*

Setting out with the caravan, Aldus’s mood is visibly light and hopeful maybe even annoyingly so. With the new lead on his situation he can't help but thinking of new possibilities, daydreaming most of the trip away allows time to pass fairly quickly. As they get closer to the Eraian border the road begins to wear ever so slightly on him, as does the seemingly never ceasing heat of the south *and we’re not even that far south yet* he thinks. Nonetheless it’s nothing a little water and the removal of some of his heavier pieces of clothing can't relieve. 

Approaching Mirashire Aldus notes the lack of travelers heading their way - a stark contrast to the past weeks. He brushes it off and carries on with his companions but as they approach the town Aldus’s uneasiness increases… something isn't right here. As the three travel into town a heavy feeling hangs in the air, bringing Aldus’s head down from the clouds and back down to earth. Devastation is apparent throughout town. A lone old woman looks their way, puts on a obviously pained smile and carries on. A man follows her and introduces himself as Tamus, offering much needed answers to the state of this border town. 

Aldus shoots the man an inquisitive look in response to his attempt in light humor. He narrows his eyes slightly and asks the question he assumes must be on Eliran and Nok… well at least Eliran's mind. “What happened here?”

**Eliran (Halim)** - *2018-02-26*

After several weeks on the road, Eliran had hoped to get a good nights sleep in Miyashire, as it was a common rest stop before entering Eraia. However, as they entered the town, he knew there would be little chance of this. 

Taking in the scene, Eliran frowned, _Either bandits are getting worse, or the Calloran and Eraian skirmishes are picking up again_ he thought to himself. As they reach the town center, a young woman and what Eliran assumes is her child disappear down a side street, and an old lady quickly breaks down before fleeing the scene. As a man approaches, Eliran looks at the broken statue, _this doesn't bode well_ he thought.
"

As Tamus makes his quip, Eliran only really had one specific question, "Did bandits do this? Or was it soldiers" he asked, gesturing to the towns clear battle damage.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-02-26*

In the time it took them to travel, Nokri did some self reflection. She wasn't wholly reformed, but she determined that *maybe* she could be a little less rude. 
The warmer weather certainly makes her feel a bit more chipper, reminding her of warm days at home before the war took over. The lack of people they meet along the trail outside of the caravan is a bit unnerving, though, and the endless farmland that started out as quaint and picturesque eventually became too repetitive. "Are we almost there yet?" Nokri would ask repeatedly despite the trio being nowhere near an established civilization. To pass the time she would chew on leaves plucked from the farms, giving a slight reprieve from her boredom.

Nokri is thrilled by the time they finally make it to the town, yet quickly disappointed. It's just another hick farm town. The burn marks were intriguing though. Somebody or something obviously went on a rampage. Flame damage was very familiar to Nokri, and had they been in the warzone she would have assumed wyverns went haywire on the place. She wondered how much it would cost to repair the town. *Whoever destroyed the place might've even done them a favor, since obviously this place wasn't exactly a sight to behold before.*

Mouth still full of leaves from the trip, Nokri stepped back when a random old lady approached them. She gaped for a moment and then walked away, only to be replaced by a man cajoling them for a free meal. Feeding him wouldn't be too out of the question depending on the answers he could provide. Luckily Aldus asked the first thing on everybody's mind. Nokri didn't feel it necessary to talk, but disposed of the matter in her mouth anyway as depending on the man's answer things could get interesting.
