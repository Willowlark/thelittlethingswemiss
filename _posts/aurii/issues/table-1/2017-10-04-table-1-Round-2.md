**Round 2**

Regalus of the The Emerald Goblet inn couldn't help but cock an eyebrow at the sight out his window. Not only customers for the squirt outside, but multiple. At the same time. Girl deserved the business, though he'd fall to the plague before he tried one of 'cures'. Regalus didn't trust anything not made by Tial. Nor would his risk his wife's wrath by having someone else's "cooking" again. Shaking his head to clear the memory of last time from his mind, he turns back to re-raveling the rope coils he was restocking, leaving his wayward 'charge' to her work. That said he kept an eye on the window when he could. One hooded figure is strange enough, but two is cause to be wary, no matter Theanovene's status as neutral ground.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2017-10-04*

What was this? In the span of only a couple minutes, a small crowd of odd people had shown up around Nokri’s modest store. Did someone put out a hit on her? She couldn’t have sold anything horrific enough to warrant that. At least, not to anyone with the kind of means or money to hire mercenaries. Judging by their appearances and demeanors the customers didn’t seem to be together. Two were covered from head to toe, albeit they each had very different fashion choices. There was a third man behind them and off to the side was another, donning armor and carrying around a crate full of who-knows what.

Nokri had goosebumps on the back of her neck and was ready to make a break for it should anything violent start. The couple that ran the general store would be of little use in a fight, plus they probably wouldn’t appreciate a mess in front of their shop. But before baseless assumptions came business. Maybe this was all a coincidence - what with different people around the market spreading word of her - and these customers would all soon be on their merry ways.

“Good day fellows,” she repeated cheerfully. “What can I do for you? Interested perhaps in a nice potion or tonic?” She exaggerated her words with an arm sweep towards the bottles and a slight bow, keeping her behavior as warm, unthreatening, and innocent as possible. “If you’d like to make a purchase I ask that you please line up, then I can help each and every one of you. One at a time!” Keeping them all in a neat row would also make it easier to keep an eye on everyone.

She turned to the closest person, presuming they would be first. “Looking for anything specific I can get you?”

**Heroth** - *2017-10-04*

Ewan was suprised by the potion seller's demeanor. This didn't seem like the attitude of a malicious mage set out to steal and poison the townfolk. A line formed with Ewan in the back, and while waiting he noticed the innkeeper from behind looking out his window at the scene playing out in the street. The other customers lining up at this shop also appeared to be from out of town and were rather strange. Perhaps they had business with the potion master, or they too were following rumors. Ewan decided to leave the back of the line and head inside.

"Pardden me innkeep, the potion maker out there. Does she rent that space from you?"

"And what business do you have with the young lady, another disgruntled customer? I won't be held liable for whatever it is she did to make you want to hide behind that hood"

Ewan approaches the counter and drops petty coin, sliding it to the innkeep
" You misunderstand good sir, I am simply new in town and was intrigued by the rumors of a potion seller who wears are more mystery than magic cure. I assume you are aware of the situation then?"
"Situation?" The innkeeper looks puzzled while he slides the coin off the counter and counts it in his palm.
 " Sure I've heard her argue with a few customers. A man looking for a potion to cure his baldspot only to be completely covered in hair, but nothing malicious and she pays her rent at the end of the week. So as long as her customers don't cause me trouble she can stay there. But I will say I've never seen so many out of towners in front of her shop."
" Thank you for your time sir."
Another dead end.
Ewan steps back out into the street and sees the potion seller still working threw the line.
The spectral spirit of knoll is sitting in the alleyway across watching the potion stall. Ewan gets back in line to listen to the strangers conversation to hopefully learn more about them.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-10-04*

Aldus steps back as one of the hooded figures in front of him filters to the back of the line. He motions for the figure in the blue hood to go ahead. “I believe you were here first” he says, trying to be polite. Since he has arrived at the curious stall a fellow wolf laguz also joined the gathering, carrying a crate. Supply delivery? Aldus decides to offer his help to the stranger 

After the crate has been taken care of Aldus steps back into line and awaits his turn. The wide array of potions and elixirs are unlike anything he has seen before, that could be a bad thing or a good thing - he's not sure.  When he reaches the stall keeper he takes a deep breath. 

“Hello, I am hoping that you could help me with a very particular personal problem I have” he tries to keep his voice low as to not be overheard by others in the area, especially Tikur, he doesn't need a reason for anyone - more so one of his own kind to judge him. Leaning over the stall slightly he says “As you can probably tell I am a wolf, but I can’t…..” he fidgets with his hands nervously “ya know… transform” his voice is barely a whisper at this point, he glances back up to meet her eyes, smiling nervously.

**Ienzo (john g)** - *2017-10-04*

Ienzo notices the person next to his gesture for him to go first. He pulls down his hood letting his long black hair free in the slight breeze. 
 " Greeting shopkeep, pleasant day were having today isnt it? It seems like im not the only one who has head a word or two about your shop." Ienzo glances behind him and lets out a little laugh.  "I hear from people all over about you shop, it's quite natorious with the locals.  I wanted to inquire about a potion or tonic that could help ease mussle pain, do you have any such item in your inventory?"  As  he waits for lady shopkeeps responce he spies a gentleman looking out the window. The first thing that comes to Ienzo's mind is to wave as he thinks it would be the polite action to take at the moment. He thinks to himself when hes done at the stand he should check out the general store as well.

**Tikur (Kurtis)** - *2017-10-05*

As Tikur was waiting for the line to go down a fellow wolf laguz had introduced himself and helped him move the crate of ingredients over to the side of the shopkeepers stand.  As he waited for the line to go down he read his old masters spell tome trying to piece together some of the more complex spells from the burnt pages.  Guess work was probably not the safest way to do this but he hadn't found another way yet.  After the line had dispersed he closed the book popped it under his arm and went to the front of the stall.  With a warm smile he introduced himself "Hello shopkeeper, nice day we're having aren't we?  I was asked to bring this crate of potion ingredients to you from an old woman on the outskirts of town.  She said you didn't need to pay her as you were a good customer of hers.  Now did you want the crate here or someplace else 
as it's decently heavy..."
