Osbury chuckles. "And I too feel like a weight has been lifted. I leave you to your own travels young miss." He turns on his heel and walks back to the stairs. At the foot of the stairs he pauses and looks over his shoulder. 

"If you ever need a hand with anything, find my tower in the city. I'd be happy to help such fine young people." he adds. He then makes way up the stairs slowly due to his age. 

(ooc: If you want to continue with Osbury you can stop him from leaving, or leave the tower. It's open ended. The courtyard is empty as well.)

Luckily the observatory is the last detour you had to make in Theanovene. Drecians seems to avoid the northern, Callorian side of the city and it makes your trip to the north gate easy. Nokri attracts a few odd looks as you leave the north gate but no one holds you up. You trip north, making your way around the mountains with Aldus leading the way. It's a thankfully uneventful trip, you barely see let alone speak to anyone on the way to the first city on your trip, Hylley.

Hylley is a beautiful city dominated by a massive tree in the center of town. The tree's roots occasionally appear in back corners or even on side walks, creating the illusion that the entire city was built upon it's root system. The buildings are made of a white stone that must be plentiful in the area, and while there are less buildings that one would expect in a capital they make up for it most buildings being multistory. The open space is often filled with manicured grassy lots, adding to the overall appeal of the city. The overall appearance is that of place where nature is prominent and respected. 

As if it's beauty was not enough, Hylley also welcomes you with the preparations for a festival in place. The large park around the central tree is buzzing with men putting together wooden structures, the overwhelmingly delicious smell of baked goods, and children being yelled at for being under foot. The banners that are being raised show images of a mountain, a waterfall from that mountain, and a familiar looking tree. Everyone working is full of smiles and laughing the day away. Whatever event is taking place, it's very popular.

Travellers that you are, you can quickly make your way to the northwest gate to continue on your journey. However upon arriving at the northern gate, you can see it's gates are barred closed. A guardsman sits in front of them on a chair he must have pulled from the guardhouse, playing with a child's toy ball and cup.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-04*

Aldus is ready for a break by the time they reach Hylley. At this point he’s not even sure he remembers what an actual bed feels like after having traveled the half the continent without resting in one. Fatigue aside, Hylley is a small wonder in itself. He thinks to suggest stopping  - especially when he smells all the delicious scents coming from the festival food - but bites his tongue and continues on. 

Aldus has to do a double take at the guardsmen to make sure that he is indeed on duty and not just a man taking a rest in a peculiar spot. Best to try an make a good impression anyway he thinks, trying to learn something from his previous encounter and subsequent scolding from Nokri. Hmmm… Nokri - best she stays here to avoid any unwanted questions. Turning around, he faces her 

“I’m going to ask why the gates are closed, but I think maybe you should stay hidden at least until I figure out what's up” he says to her. 

 He stops next to the window of a seeming unoccupied building and looks at his reflection in the glass. He stands taller, straightens his pack on his shoulder, straightens out his hair, and puts on a winning smile - making sure to check his teeth. He nods at himself approvingly in the window and walks over to the boredom stricken man. 

“Good day sir! I’ve just arrived in town,regretfully though I cannot stay long. Would you be able to tell me why the gates are closed?”

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2017-12-06*

This new town was neat and welcoming. Almost too neat and welcoming, and Nokri repeatedly swiveled her head around suspiciously to take in the sights just as she had while on the road. Her eyes lingered on food stands with the strongest scents wafting from them, her mind on the same page as Aldus's for the first time ever, though she didn't let it show. With how smoothly they were progressing, Nokri's mood magically seemed to lift a bit, and she even had the hint of a genuine smile on her face due to the lively festival atmosphere.

But then of course the gate was closed and being guarded. The sourness returned to her face. Walking through a town couldn't be so simple, *something* had to impede them. She had half a mind of going up to the guard and yanking the toy of his hand.  Before she did though Aldus stopped her. Nokri nodded at his words and instead plopped down on the ground to wait. After settling down on the side of the road somewhere relatively tidy and dirtless, she looked up and snickered at how he spiffed himself up in the window. It would've been funnier if there were people inside watching.

Suddenly figuring this would be as good a time as any, Nokri stood up again ran over to a stall. They were getting ready for the festival and popping some kind of butter-coated kernels over heat. "Could I please get two servings of this?" she inquired, taking out some change she brought from Theanovene. One was for her and one was, kindly, for Aldus. As long as he hurried and returned before Nokri had the chance to finish hers and start eating his portion.
