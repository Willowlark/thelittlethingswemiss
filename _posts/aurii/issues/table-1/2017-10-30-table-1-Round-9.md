**Bill** - *2017-10-30*

Theanovian miltiamen approach and arrest Tikur and Ienzo, binding their hands tightly with room. The men are not particularly motivated to do so, but they do their job well. As the two of you are brought over with the rest of the arrested individuals, one militiaman with his mid length hair pulled back into a ponytail says "Seems like you had the right intentions friends, but neutral ground is neutral ground. Please cooperate and we'll have this sorted out in a jiffy." He then jogs off to assist the rest of his squad.

One of the Eraians break from the circle and steps right in front of the draconic ZaRel. "Over here demonspawn?" he shouts. He bangs the hilt of his spear against his shield and makes a terrible racket. Everyone outside the Eraian unit is forced to throw their hands over their ears as all the soldiers do the same with their weapons. 

Unbeknownst to onlookers, the Eraians were doing far more than pissing off everyone around them. The signal started, soldiers on the nearby inn roof toss dozens of ropes over the dragon. The minute they do all of the soldier on the ground dive for an end each, pulling them tight around ZaRel's form. They stick their weapons into the ground, lancing the ropes for extra stability. One Eraian shouts to get some proper nets and men move like they've been posessed. The Theanovian militiamen don't assist, but they don't prevent the Eraians from their operation. The Theanovians were frankly put off by the idea of a dragon in the modern era what-so-ever, and had no better plan to suggest.

In short time the market comes together to provide enough netting and material to properly capture the dragon. The ponytailed miltiaman and the Eraian who was shouting orders before (A blonde, clean shaven young man in heavy armor) have begun an argument over the capture.

"I'll hear none of that!" The Eraian barks. "We captured the dragon, with our plan! You shall not take it from us! We even listened to your request to not engage it in full combat in your streets!"

"We can't have you dragging it through the streets either sir. We assure you, we have no interest in a mythical beast, especially one so tied with Lyarlel." the Theanovian says placatingly. The Eraian blinks at the religious reference, clearly this Theanovian was well studied. "We just want to lock the creature away while we coordinate a way to let you do what you wish!"

"We wish to slaughter the beast that taints Lylalel's lands, and we can simply do that her-" the Eraian is cut off.

"No no no, this is a market. Children play here. Where ever that thing is killed will be swimming in dragon blood, envitiably descrated as unholy ground by Lylalel. You can't slay it in the city, and that's all we ask! We want the same thing here sir!" the Theanovian pleas. Be it because of the second reference to Lylalel's religion or just common sense, the Eraian sighs and extends a hand.

"Alright, I believe you. You say you have cages in the travelling circus that can hold it?" The Eraian trails off, the two's voices returning to a normal level.

(ooc: This scene has ended. Status:
* Tikur and Ienzo have been taken to jail.
* ZaRel has been brought to a travelling circus and currently occupies one of the elephant cages, still in dragon form.
* Nokri and Aldus are together, Aldus tailing Nokri's escape. 
Table-1 is reduced to Nokri and Aldus. When Tikur/Ienzo/ZaRel are ready to pick up their scenes, they'll occupy table-3 or possibly a table-4 I'll add.)

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-11-01*

Getting through the crowd was made easier by the fact that people were still stunned by the potion girl pushing through just seconds before. As he comes around the corner of a building he sees the end of her blonde ponytail duck around another building into a small alleyway. They’ve been running awhile but Aldus isn’t fazed, “Keeping up with the pack is much harder than this” he thinks. He runs up to the alleyway and sees her there, getting ready to run again. “Wait!” he says,  hoping she will hear him out.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2017-11-05*

A somewhat familiar face rounded the corner. It was the dog boy from earlier, who had gotten interrupted by the soldier's arrival. She vaguely recalled him not aiding the Drecans in attempting to capture her, and perhaps even helping her escape though she honestly hadn't paid much attention to whatever was going on at the time. Despite running all that way he didn't seem nearly as tired as she was. *And don't these guys, like, have super-powered scent receptors or some crap? S**t.* Absconding wasn't worth it at the moment. But if he tried anything Nokri would reopen the scabbed wound on her shoulder and run into the street, pretending to be some damsel in distress getting chased by the big bad wolf.

"Yeah. Can I *help* you?" Nokri asked breathlessly, her voice now dripping with sarcasm and strong hints of a Drecan account.  Though this was a customer, business hours had closed for the day and she decided to give up on the nice girl act. "What'd ya chase me for?"

```Location: Back streets of Theanovene
Characters: Aldus and Nokri```

After a short break to fully catch her breath and wipe the sweat off her forehead, Nokri led the laguz through the winding city streets. Most of them were dark and quiet, with the occasional resident sitting out front eyeing them as the duo walked past. "Did you say your name earlier? Mine's Nokri," she stated, figuring she might as well hear his name if they'd be travelling together. "I heal people. You?" After about fifteen minutes they turned down a street that looked identical to all the others and walked up to an indistinct door. Nokri swiveled her head around to check for nosy neighbors before unlocking the door. "Stay," she told Aldus, letting her inexperience with and insensitivity towards non-humans blatantly show as she held up her hand in a 'stop' motion and continued inside the house on her own, though she left the door open.

Nokri didn't have many things and her house was mainly empty aside from lots of random plant material laying about and an assortment of strange stains on the carpet. It was a very tiny one room home. Kicking some piles aside, she stuffed a weighty pouch  and several handfuls of potential potion ingredients into a shoulder bag before giving the room a quick glance to make sure nothing else necessary got left behind.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-11-06*

Aldus follows the girl through some dark streets that look a little sketchy in his opinion but he tries not to judge. “Aldus” he says in response to her question. At least he can stop calling her potion girl now, he muses to himself. 

He’s a little put off by her command to him, but he gives her the benefit of the doubt for now that she didn't mean it offensively. He noseley looks into her home but listens and doesn't follow her inside the tiny room as nothing in there seems of much interest to him anyway. He leans against the wall outside the door, hoping they can get on their way soon.
