(ooc: Keep your last round in mind as you write what happens next in your part of the fight. If you got hit, include that as part of your response. If you're doing well, run with it!)

(ooc: When describing a generic mook, give them a simple, identifiable trait. *The guy the goatee* or *the girl with the blonde ponytail* or *the guy whose got 3 daggers on his belt*. It'll make figuring out whose interacting with what mook so much easier for me, as well as for each other. These details shouldn't do any more than identify them, *the guy with the legendary sword excalibur* isn't going to be a simple detail. Rank is another one to avoid, it gives the mook a reason to get upgrade by me into a full *named enemy*.)

The Drecian captain swallows audibly. Despite the rather immediate and aggressive response on the part of what look like total strangers he shows just why he's in charge. 

"They drew first blood boys, but it's not ours that'll coat the streets!" He shouts as he draws his sword. He rolls out of the way of the fearsome lightning cage, his warrior instincts guiding him through with only a glancing blow. He looks back at his men and points his blade forward. "What are you waiting for? Give em HELL!" He belows and the men charge forward, engaging the combatants in twos and threes each.

The captain himself closes the distance between himself and Tikur. He leans into it at the last moment to do a triangle of slashes, the first low across Tikur's thighs, then up across his chest and the final one return the blade to the ready. The captain stays in close, not willing to let the spell caster sling more magic. 

"You'll regret attacking Dreca. Everyone will." he says with a chill in his voice. The catchlights to his eyes are gone, only the dark pupils seems to stare at Tikur.

The door to the general store slams open and the bear of man that goes by Regalus steps through it. 

"Kiddo, get in 'ere!" he shouts at Nokri. While his stature makes him look more than capable as a fighter a trained eye can notice his hand quivering on the doorknob of the door. Still, he looks pointedly at the young girl who he's gotten to know in the last few months. While she's a tad... quirky, Regalus had picked up a soft spot for the girl.

**ZaRel (Nick)** - *2017-10-17*

*I overestimated how much he could handle.* ZaRel thinks to himself as the soldiers split up and gang up on each of the friendly fighters 4-to-1. He is visibly shaken by his own miscalculation, the color slightly drains from his face as he faces the diappointment within himself. *If I can't give proper direction then I might as well try to add another body to the fray.* ZaRel then jumps off of the roof of the general store, completes a flip and lands on the ground with a somersault that forms into a sprint towards the Captain. *That spellcaster may be in trouble if he doesn't know how to fight hand to hand. I may not be much help myself, but maybe I can at least distract the guy he is fighting so that he can get a chance to make attacks.*

As ZaRel reaches the fighters he runs behind the Captain and hits him with a couple small jabs. His small stature doesn't have much power behind it, but it may be anough to pull his attention off of the spellcaster. When the Captain retalliates ZaRel avoids the strikes adeptly by limboing away from horizontal strikes, spinning away from vertical strikes, and jumping back from thrusts. As he maneuvers his white hair flows around, however, he makes sure to keep his ears covered. A fight with soldiers is definitely not where he wants to be recognized for what he truly is. After each dodge ZaRel places a couple well placed jabs to try to knock the Captain of balance so that he forgets about the spellcaster and focuses on the child that is moving around so quickly.

ZaRel grows bored of dodging and jabbing very quickly. He wants something else on his mind. He glances around the battlefield at his allies being attacked by the soldiers. ZaRel shouts out warnings to the outnumbered foes between dodges and jabs. "Ienzo, eyepatch behind you!" as a soldier with an eyepatch and a scimitar sidesteps out of Ienzo's sight and tries to get a free hit on the unarmed man. "Potion girl, duck!" as a bolt flies towards her, shot by a short man with a thick beard holding a crossbow. "Archer, their bowmen are taking aim at you. You'd best take them out first before supporting us!"

After that last command the Captain nearly chops ZaRel's arm off so he makes the tactical decision to retreat from him and help the others. ZaRel removes himself from the fight with the Captain with a few back handsprings and manages to get a solid 15 feet away from the captain. *To advance towards me is to retreat from the spellcaster. Make your choice.*

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2017-10-19*

One of the Drecan soldiers blocked her way before Nokri could make it around the side of the building. She prompty spun on her heel and turned to run right back the way she came, back into the fray that was getting more chaotic by the moment. Due to the crowd and various acts of violence Nokri was stuck clinging by the wall. At any moment an opportunity could open up, allowing her to run past the fighting and escape. That was exactly the chance she was waiting for. But she was getting antsy and impatient.

No openings happened. Instead, one of the soliders saw her and, acting on adrenaline and bloodlust of the moment, thrust his knife at her shoulder. Blood soaked through her shirt and trickled down her arm as she attempted to kick him between the legs. She impulsively dug her nails into the skin around the wound as she covered it with her palm to slow the blood flow. Her arm was angled to protect her neck so that any attack aimed at a jugular would fall on her elbow instead.

The soldier was about to go in for a second blow when the door of the general store opened, smacking them in the side with enough force to knock off his balance. A familiar voice rang out. Almost blindly, Nokri followed it and ran into the store, rushing to the back. She could hear a female voice within the store screeching in panic and annoyance about the commotion out front. Gratefully, Nokri shouted a “thanks!” and rushed her way to the back of the store. Ideally, she would exit out a back door or window, but the soldiers might be expecting that and she didn’t want to bleed out. Instead she grabbed a piece of gauze from a shelf. Pulling up her sleeve hurriedly, she spit on the wound and began wrapping the gauze. Within seconds the bandaging was complete, leaving only dried blood on her arm and a throbbing pain that could be ignored in the moment, and she cautiously peered through a window to check the situation outside.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-10-19*

An crossbow bolt whizzes by his right ear close enough to hear. Aldus recoils from the sound, startled by just how close it came to giving him an ear piercing - well, *another* ear piercing that is. He hears a warning of archers preparing to fire back at him come from a small voice below.

“You’re not kidding!” he responds- not really knowing who he’s talking too. His eyes narrow at the soldier that shot that bolt. 

Despite the uniform the shooter is quite the shady looking fellow, he’s smiling sickly up at him and with only about 3 teeth to do so with. Aldus straffes a few steps down along the roof to his left before pulling another arrow from his quiver and aiming it at the arm the soldier is using to support his crossbow. He pulls back once again and fires. Just as intended his crossbow clatters uselessly to the ground as the arrow connects and the man grabs at the arrow now embedded in his arm. Another archer steps in front of her fallen companion, definitely, vengefully - this one’s a woman with long dirty blonde colored hair pulled into a tight top knot. Fire in her eyes she returns the shot for her friend. Just in time, Aldus leans back on his thighs, straight backed as the arrow flies harmlessly past him. She grits her teeth angrily in response. 

“One for me, and one for you!” he says with a smile and shot to her hand. “And another one for your boyfriend too!”  intending to give Mr.Shady a wound on his other arm to match the first.

Incapacitating all the archers he can see, he scans the marketplace in search of the head asshole. He locates him near to where he saw him last, this time trading punches from a... small child? 

“Oookay then…” Aldus says under his breath “might as well help the kid out I suppose” He takes a few steps back onto the spine of the roof standing with his feet placed squarely beneath him he pulls out another arrow, takes aim and fires another shot at the one in charge, aiming at a pulled back arm readying to swing.

**Ienzo (john g)** - *2017-10-19*

With all the fighting going on around him Ienzo tries to stay focused on the guys around him. He thinks to himself "I need to wrap this up quickly and help the others out as quick as i can." while he is distracted by his thoughts he hears a voice call out to him letting him know someone snuck up behind him.  with one swift motion he swings around and punches the soldier in his good eye. He picks up the  the blinded eye patched soldier and swung him like a club to knock all the soldiers around him to the ground. " your lucky i try not to kill unless I have too, is something like this really worth spilling blood over?" he asks the soldiers he just knocked to the ground.  After waiting a minute and the soldiers didnt answer he decides they aren't gonna change there minds easily.  He sees what looks like to be the guy in charge going after the mage and even wounding his new half-dragon friend. Ienzo looks at the soldiers and with his most mencing look tells them  "stay still or else, I dont want any innocent people to get involved in this stupid and piontless fight.  Ienzo slips up behind the leader looking soldier and tries to deliver a quick yet powerful punch to the back of the head hoping to knock him out in one punch, hoping he can end this scuffle before it esculates any farther.
