**Bill** - *2017-12-18*

Not even a minute after Eliran tucks himself into the armoire the dresser that had been your sole safeguard falls forward. Over the top climb not just Brickface and Meatslab but more men dressed similiarly. 

"If you two know what's best for you, tell us where the rat went. We don't mean you any harm, despite our entrance." Brickface says. He doesn't smile, but it does seem he's trying to reassure you. 

"To hell with it Orar. They've got to be allies of his, why else would they let him into their room?" Meatslab says to his compatriot. 

"He could have just barged into an open door Lac." Orar says with an aside glance. 

"And if they are his allies? The boss will be furious. I'm not going to take that risk." Lac adds decisively. He motions with a hand and the other men filter around the outside of the room. "We're going to need you to come with us. If the rat is still listening, know that if anything happens to these two it's your fault." 

Orar almost looks to argue, but shrugs and motions for Aldus and Nokri to head to the door. 

(ooc: It's up to you what you want to do. In particular, don't feel like fighting isn't a option because they have more people, all the nameless men are just mooks.)

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2017-12-20*

By the time the door burst open and their new guests came stomping in, Nokri had already switched to being a damsel in distress, sitting uselessly on the corner of a bed. She shrieked and covered her face with a pillow. "T-the window!" she squeaked, pointing to the wide open window and billowing curtains. "He fell from there and r-ran west, or down the street that way." (ooc: unreliable expositor)

"You men are after him, right? That guy threatened us, what an awful man. Please find him. He can't be left to terrorize the town." She hugged the pillow, shaking like a leaf. After all the walking they had done to get here, Nokri really didn't feel like leaving the room and just wanted a break. She feigned an attempt to stand up and move to the door as they ordered, but only rose a couple inches from the bed before falling down again. "I c-can't move my legs..." she whispered, as though the fear was too strong and the shock of the whole ordeal was too much to handle.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-20*

Putting a believable shake in his voice he cowers slightly and says to the men “Please, sirs we want nothing to do with whoever that mad man was. My fiance and I are here celebrating our engagement, we want nothing more than to enjoy the festival with rest of the good people of Hylley and make memories. We just arrived here when that man crashed into us, said some things I’d rather not repeat and proceeded to escape out the window and run off. Detaining us would only waste time you could be looking for him”

 He walks over to where Nokri is sitting on the bed and puts his arms around her in false comfort giving a gentle squeeze. *she’s going to kill me for this later* he thinks “Now please, this has given us quite the shock and my beloved is very faint of heart” he says to the men before turning to her “It’s ok honey, he’s gone now, everything's gonna be ok, I’m here”

**Eliran (Halim)** - *2017-12-20*

_These people are way to good for me_ Eliran thought, hiding out in his armoire. He had doubted that the two would stick to their end of the deal after being threatened with being taken just because they happened to be in the room. Still, the issue had yet to resolve itself, so he sat poised with his small blade, ready to jump out of the armoire and stab whichever Meatslab is closest.
