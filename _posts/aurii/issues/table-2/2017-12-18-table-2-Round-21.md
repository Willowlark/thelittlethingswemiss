**Bill** - *2017-12-18*

It is a quick half hour and you find yourselves heading out of the garrison. As you step out you can say a sizable amount of men grouped up, more than you'd seen in the garrison before. Ransford is their front, barking orders which are immediately preformed. There's no hesitation in the men, Ransford says jump and they jump as high as they can. Many of the men carry lanterns which light the area, while there is a decent amount of moonlight tonight there are also quite a few clouds to block it.

"Faun!" Ransford shouts. He motions for the two of you to come to the front. As you do, you can see three horses at the front as well.

"Each of you can take a horse, or if the lady prefers you might ride together." he says, still waving one of his men onto a new task. "You'll guide the way, once we're at the cabin we'll debrief quickly and the two of you can stay back, Faun to protect your charge and Mi'lady Tyndall as it's not your role to be a combatant here." he continues, mounting his own horse. He finally looks your way. Ransford nods at you once, making eye contact with each of you in turn. The man seems incredibly at home in front of a squadron of men.

"Alright, we're moving out!" he calls and looks at the two of you expectantly to start leading.

**Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ )** - *2017-12-19*

Afina looked up at the horses. Sharing a horse? How antiquated. Elfriede looked at her, head cocked, indicating that the decision was clearly up to her. Afina pursed her lips and walked forward, positioning one foot in the stirrup to hoist herself up onto the saddle. She struggled, and a few soldiers stepped forward to assist her, but she briskly shooed them aside. Every noble knew how to ride, of course. But that didn't mean it was easy. 

Finally, she hoisted herself up, adjusting her tunic and taking out one of her tome book from her pack. She positioned it between her lap and the saddle. Ransford said she was a non-combatant, huh? She'd show him. Behind her back, Ransford began barking orders once more, and she rolled her eyes at him. 

When he finished, Ransford got their attention, and locked eyes with both the nobles in turn, before his gaze softened. Oh! He expected them to lead. Finally. Afina comfortably adjusted to the new, proper position. She nodded at Elfriede, and then began to read from the tome. This would teach Ransford to question her ability.

Ahead on the path, up in the air, a white ball of light shown, bobbing and wavering in the darkness. Eraian soldiers were accustomed to light magic by then, but that didn't mean that it was necessarily the most common thing to see. Many stopped mid-conversation and stared, the brilliant light shining on all the lines and scars on their faces. Afina heard a quick whoop from one soldier and smiled to herself, continuing to read from the book to shine the way. THAT would show them.

She paused a moment to nod at Elfriede, gesturing that he direct the now-attentive crowd with a few words.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-19*

Elfriede nodded to Afina and turn to face the crowd, glancing at Ransford to make sure he had permission to lead. 

    Elfriede straightens and speaks in a practiced militarized voice, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll lead you to the shack. I'm sure you've been briefed but the Lagu there are all incapacitated. I don't expect it to take us very long. An hour or two at most. We shouldn't meet any resistance, unless this one shack was part of a larger group. That‚Äôs all, lets move out. Lady Afina will light the way.‚Äù

    Faun mounts his horse and trots up to the lead with Afina while motioning Ransford to follow with his men that had assembled. 

    ‚ÄúOnce we get there and get this mess cleaned up we should be able to head out toward the main land in search of *somewhere* to rest thats fitting. Although we may have to get comfortable with the fact that we might have to camp. Although I am quite sure that the idea did not escape you. Even nobles have to camp from time to time.‚Äù 

    Elfriede took the moment to think about the events of the day, the trials, the arguing. He felt every fiber of his being was tired. He had been through more in the last day then his military training put him through on a regular basis. (At least since he ranked up to be important enough, the younger ranks and boot camp were rough) He found himself thinking about a luxurious inn to rest at with fine furnishing and a huge bath. There was one he had stayed at in his youth during a short family getaway when his father was on business with the military. He didn't appreciate it as much as a preteen boy... but now. 

    ‚ÄúAh.. It‚Äôll just make that bath when I finally get it all the sweeter.‚Äù He glanced over to Afina filled with sudden energy. ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm going to have to splurge when we get back to Eraia. I have some more time left of my leave and my family is allowing me a few days to spend it how I wish.‚Äù
