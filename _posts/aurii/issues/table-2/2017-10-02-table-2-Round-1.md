**Round 1**

Tyndall Tower is tucked away behind one of the many libraries on Scribe Street. Despite it's 4 floors leaving it taller than the library ahead of it, it doesn't garner too much attention as some noble buildings in Theanovene tend to do. Rather uninspired to look at from the outside, it's courtyard entrance is accessed via a side alley of things. It's large wood doors are rather uninspired as well.

What the outside lacks the inside relishes in. Rugs cover the hardwood floors and plush furniture decorates each floor. More walls are bookshelves than brick, stuffed to the brim with books and scrolls covering any topic you can imagine. The tower lacks in lavish gold and decorations, instead adorned with practical luxuries such as globes and tapestries. It's here one Afina Tyndall resides, Callorian Princess of the kingdom of Laera. While the princess had been expecting a particular letter any day now, little did she know she'd have much more in the way of visitors today. Some looking for her position, and another with a long awaited letter. 

(OOC: OOC stands for *Out of Character*, we have channels for this buy I may throw them in as the GM. I've set a scene here to bring you all together, but going forward it's what your characters want to do, and how they interact with things and people.

Don't forget to describe your character for the rest of us, no harm in details! First posts are a nightmare, if you're stuck just describe how you're coming to see Afina.)

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-10-02*

The directions Elfriede Faun had gotten were not hard to follow, the tower stood out clearly. His left hand resting on the hilt of his slender sword he walked towards the tower with perfect posture. Though he isn't very tall and has a very young face he has an air of maturity about him. Groomed but shaggy brown hair and duelist plate armour with the insignia of Eraia on the chest. 
Elfriede wasn't exactly sure what the importance of this letter was he was to deliver to Afina but orders are orders; and he has never defied orders.
He passed all the rabble in the street, which included a beggar asking for a handout, without a second thought, even managed a  quiet scoff. 
The boy stood before the tower knocked swiftly twice and sighed. Just promoted to knight-leiutenant and now he's acting as a courier. What a joke.

**Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ )** - *2017-10-02*

Despite its unremarkable exterior, the inside of Tyndall Tower was in a flurry of bright liveliness. Afina Tyndall, the tower‚Äôs main occupant, bustled from corner to corner inside the tower, collecting books and scrolls from the shelves of the main library. She had recently made what she believed to be a breakthrough in her studies, and was hoping to confirm these new findings. 

She splayed the books across her desk in the center of the room, placing her hands on her hips and surveying her collection. She smiled to herself, proud of the books she had gathered before her. It was rare, if not unheard of, for new spells associated with light magic to be developed. Clearly whoever created that story hadn‚Äôt taken the Laeran people into account, she thought.

About to dive into her books, Afina‚Äôs eyes hesitated on the royal blue banner that hung above the library‚Äôs fireplace. On it, an owl with wings outstretched flew, clasping an olive branch in its talons. She pursed her lips, the banner of her kingdom reminding her of home. She missed Laera. Her hometown, her family, her people. Everything. 

Afina shook off the thought, tucking her bright blonde hair behind her ear and opening up a scroll. She spread the scroll, using books to hold the rolled piece of parchment in place, and began to trace the symbols with her finger, murmuring her incantations quietly. The library began to fill with a soft light that perforated every corner of the room, escaping into the hallway through a crack in the door. So far so good, Afina thought.

**Kailyn (John B)** - *2017-10-03*

‚ÄúAh, so this is where the Callorian princess is residing,‚Äù she scoffed with a sharp tongue. The bland tower with its stone and mortar was underwhelming, moreso with the moss growing between the cracks and grids of grey rock. Alas, this must be her first step in her path of knowledge and arcana.

Her preparations out-did herself, having a dress of spring flowers tethered to a earthly cloth, and an emerald, satin ribbon tied around her hair to finish the ensemble. While the original garment was of a *‚Äôborrowed‚Äô* hand-maiden‚Äôs uniform, she worked around the working class style by tossing the apron and bonnet, and covering the seams with bouquets of flowers, each stem having to be stabbed into the fabric. The ribbon was tied together forming a small green bow on the right-side of her brown hair, partially covering one of her tabby-patterned ears. Her cheeks and lips had a light-red hue, giving her a more focused complexion when up close. While her ears and tail still stuck out, something she chose to leave as a matter of principle, it seemed to do nothing except bring more attention to the dress, as if they are accessories needed for completion.

She recalled her previous pacing and pondering, attempting to plan out each situation that could follow and how she should approach them. She thought it best to use the front door, people tend to befriend visitors more than sleuths. Still, sneaking in would be an effective Plan B. As for the servant that would answer, for she was certain the princess or another noble wouldn‚Äôt come to answer, she still pondered if they would let her in. In past experiences, she found servants to be bland or over-protective of their masters, giving no curiosity to the questions in front of them unless they were truly entertaining. Her outfit might make her pass as not lower class, but nothing is certain.

She also wrote a small introductory letter in case she couldn‚Äôt get through, trying to be as polite to noble society as possible. She sighed, wondering if she just overthought this whole endeavor. She should just step up to the door and- her attention was quickly drawn away to the boy at the front entrance.

*‚ÄùWhat‚Äôs this?‚Äù* she pondered, seeing his blade and stance. *‚ÄùHe seems rather young; perhaps he‚Äôs a squire or new recruit?‚Äù* Her mind raced with different options, problems, and solutions. A quick smirk was given before calming herself with a gentle composure. She glided over to the young man, letter pressed between her two thumbs and index fingers, but kept pristine to keep from crimping.

Her plan was set and she would take any advantage given to her.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2017-10-03*

Near the far end of Scribe Street, a wolf is seen striding towards the Tyndall Tower. The wolf‚Äôs snow white colored fur glistens in the sun, while it‚Äôs deep grey eyes do not wander. With every step taken a howl can be heard echoing through the streets mesmerizing all who listen. 

As the wolf approaches the Tyndall Tower, the howling seems to stop and the wolf seamlessly transforms into a muscular Laguz female. 
‚ÄúI‚Äôve finally arrived! The time has come to finish my challenge,‚Äù Atalantia thinks to herself as she braces towards the large wooden doors of the tower. It is at that moment, that she pushes aside two travelers, lanky in comparison, who stand directly in front of the doors.

Despite being unfamiliar with this location, Atalantia was not phased by the new environment. She had come for one purpose; Atalantia had to find the daughter of the royal family in Laera so that she may form a symbol of alliance with her. Only after forming an alliance would she be recognized as a formidable opponent by the Wynne men.
