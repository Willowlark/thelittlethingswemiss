As you enter *The Traveler's Lodge* a bell on the door rings briskly through the main room. "Welcome ye to Lylalel's light; welcome to my shelter from the dark." You hear from the man behind the desk. The lodge is not your typical inn. There is no bar in the main room, the room is instead set up in a smaller separated sitting areas with couches and tables. One of these is by a fireplace on the east wall. There's a staircase on the far side of that wall as well. Two doors are on the back wall, one on either side of the man's counter space. On the counter is a small pedestal holding a snow white candle, burning despite the midday hour. Two shards of glass sit in the rim of the candle's holder, making it look like it once had a glass shell but most of it broke. 

After Elfriede responds 'We are sheltered and blessed by Lylalel', the man smiles and roots around beneath his counter for a moment. When you approach he has three keys in hand, one with a square bow and two with circular ones. "Women's baths to the right, men's to the left." he says, pushing the keys in each direction. "Keys are for the locking cabinets you can stow your possessions in." 

Inside each door is a similar room. The center of the room is a grouping of benches and chairs with a small table or two between. The east and west walls are lined with cabinets with key holes, true to the host's words. Steam wafts from the hallway directly opposite the door. You can hear the sound of water beyond that hallway.

The bath area itself is fairly large, almost half the room being a warm water pool, 3 feet deep all around. The steam definitely wafts from this pool, you can see the light misting of it on the water. Across from that is a 1 foot deep pool with water flowing down from above. This miniature waterfall never seems to fill the pool, the flow into and out of the pool is perfectly in sync. There's a smaller pool with a bit of a current to it, it also seems soapy as people scrub themselves clean and let the current wash away the grime. People are relaxing in the pool and washing their hair in the waterfall area. 

When you leave the baths, warm and refreshed, you find out there's no charge for the use of a Traveler's Lodge. The lodge is funded by church donations. The clerk then urges you visit the local church, as it's truly integral to being in Eraia. He lets you know there are rooms for rent on the second and third floors of this building if you'd like, or there is other lodgings on the other side of the city. He then turns to another guest with the same welcoming phrase as before.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-02-07*

Faun sighed as he entered the bathing area. He had gotten pretty good at the song and dance of concealing his *‚Äùfamilies secret‚Äù* but it had always put a great deal of stress on him. 

‚ÄúAh.. but I really do want to bath though.‚Äù He said quietly to himself. Elfriede removed his armour and disrobed down to his pants. He swiftly wrapped a towel around his waist and kicked his trousers and undergarments off, placing them into his locker. 

He shuffled to an open spot in the water and got in, as far away from others as possible. He submerged himself never stopping to remove the towel; People usually shrugged it off as if he was really shy and usually didn't give him much trouble.

Elfriede relaxed for a moment and then proceeded to clean all the built up‚Ä¶. *everything* from the events earlier this week. They had really been through a lot in a short time together. 

A short time later he emerged refreshed and dried off. He noted his tail was no longer matted down and gross and was fluffy once more, which somehow gave him a strange satisfaction.

Elfriede put on his clothing and armour once again and gathered his things before heading into the lobby. He leaned up against the wall by the women's baths to wait for Afina and Atalantia to emerge refreshed themselves. 

‚ÄúI haven't seen you clean in a while. I was beginning to forget what my traveling companions looked like after a good bath.‚Äù He mused at ~~Afrin~~ Afina when she exited. He decided not to press after noticing her light scowl.

"Once Atalantia arrives we'll head out to the market to buy clothes and neccesities if you are ready."

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-02-07*

Upon enetering the female bathing area, Atalantia found herself talking more to Afina. Both individuals try to shine light on their perspectives of matters involving culture and personal abilities. While Afina did not go too in depth with her own personal background, Atalantia was glad to finally get a moment to form more of a bond. 

Atalantia chose to lay back into the calm bath water and closed her eyes as she conversed with Afina. It had been a long while since she received a thorough cleaning both physically and mentally. Physically the bath helped to sooth Atalantia's tense muscles that were still recovering from the injuries sustained during the battle with Rica. Mentally, the bath helped to provide a sort of relaxation that Atalantia had not felt in a long time. Since the start of her journey she was encountering new experiences every day such as learning of new areas, earning trust from her friends, and fighting against her own laguz kind in order to seek a sort of justice for their crimes. Such experiences were vastly different from the ones Atalantia encountered in her tribe, and they all seemed to happen at once. Atalantia wasn't necessarily saddened by any of these experiences, but she was certainly mentally drained from it all. Despite this fact she couldn't necessarily consult in her friends either, for she refused to seem weak. Therefore, the bath seemed to be the best and greatest method of self care that Atalantia could find at this moment.

Noticing Afina leave the bathing area, Atalantia took a few more minutes to enjoying the relieving properties that the bath had to offer. She made sure not to take too long, and eventually grabbed her towel and torn clothes in effort to prepare to meet with Elfriede and Afina.

**Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ )** - *2018-02-07*

Afina exited the changing room, her elegant features pulled into a grim frown. Elfriede greeted her as she exited, and she nodded solemnly. ‚ÄúNaturally, a bath was in order for all of us,‚Äù Afina replied, her neutral tone giving her mood away. A pang of guilt ran through her; Elfriede nor Atalantia was to blame for any of the things affecting her mood right now. Why should she take her feelings out on them?

Afina straightened up and relaxed her shoulders in an effort to calm herself. She shouldn‚Äôt be taking out her feelings on her friends. "Once Atalantia arrives we'll head out to the market to buy clothes and necessities if you‚Äôre ready," Elfriede said, and Afina folded her hands over her lap.

‚ÄúWell, that would be the best place to acquire provisions for our trip. We may be in Eraia already but there is still much ahead of us. And after our training sessions, my books seem to be getting thinner and thinner,‚Äù she laughed, trying to sound good-natured. Perhaps such a skill wasn‚Äôt necessarily the princess‚Äô forte, however. Her awkward laughter peetered out, and and awkward silence fell between the true. Thankfully, it was soon interrupted by Atalantia.

‚ÄúTo the market?‚Äù Afina inquired, nodding towards the door.
