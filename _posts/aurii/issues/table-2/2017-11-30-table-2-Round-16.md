Onfroi pushes Kailyn to the ground as Elfreide daggers cuts at his wrist. He steps forward with a loud thump on the floorboards and slams his shoulder into Elfreide. He stalks closer to Elfreide's new prone position and growls as Elfreide's dagger cuts him again. 

"Stay down, Human dog!" he yells and stamps down on the downed Elfreide's head with his boot. Satisfied with the groan, Onfroi kicks the knight's head like a soccer ball and grabs his knife again. He heads for the prone Kailyn and grabs her wrists with one massive hand. He pulls Kailyn back up and interposes her between him and the and the window Afina is couched under.

Archaim twists so his back is to the inner wall of the shack. He holds the knife closer to Atalantia's neck, his other hand wrapped around her waist in an attempt to limit her mobility. 

"Drop those swords on the ground girl, there's no need for you to get hurt." he says over her shoulder. He nods to Rudi and backs up further, making sure Elfreide or whoever was in the window can't get behind him.

Rudi and Anneke both dove for cover when the light went off. They come out from behind the bed as the light fades and take stock of the situation. Rudi points to the window and Anneke nods, the Kissaelain laguz sprinting across the room to the door. Rudi follows behind her, closing the door behind her as she runs outside. Rudi twists and presses his back to the door, taking stock of the now quite injured Elfreide. 

(ooc: The is no dice rolling after this round. Any dice you've acquired will be added to the dice you acquire next round. Think of it as there are multiple posts to the round as a whole. While Rudi and Anneke have names, they are effectively mooks in the scenario. Archaim and Onfroi are able to roll dice to do damage the same as you guys are. The dice you've received this round is posted in the dice channel.)

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-11-30*

Elfriede's head started pounding as the heavy boot bore down on his temple. Before he could regain his senses another boot came forward striking him in the cheek. Waves of nausea shot through him and blood trickled down his face as he was sent back. Fighting to stay conscious he watched as the burly tiger man picked up Kailyn easily, even with his wounds.

Elfriede hand slowly found it's way to his sword lying near him on the floor. He glanced up. The man was looking the other way‚Ä¶ the fool...
Elfriede stood up fast headbutting as hard as he could into the tiger laguz crotch. 

There was a loud thud as K fell to the floor again.
He felt the distinct animalistic urge to bite him on the neck as he rose. But shook off the feeling with practiced ease.

As the Lagu recoiled from the stinging sensation in his groin Elfriede wrapped his left arm around his throat, gritted his teeth. 

‚ÄúYou are a fool to turn your back on a knight of Eraia.‚Äù 

The boy pushed his rapier between the man-beast‚Äôs ribs and out the front.

Even then Elfriede felt his consciousness fading..as pain waves pulsed from his crushed tail, his battered head and shoulder this fight had to be ended quickly.

**Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ )** - *2017-11-30*

Afina let out a small whoop as she watched Elfriede make a fighting comeback. K would be free to assist now, which would make for a much fairer fight. Elfriede and K had the first tiger laguz under control, so Afina turned her attention to the one holding Atalantia. Popping her knuckles, she triumphantly flipped the pages on her book, landing on a defensive spell that she had been fine tuning for a while. 

She read quickly, fingers tracing the lines of text with ease. Popping up from over the window sill, Afina focused on the second tiger laguz, positioning her magic to defend Atalantia, and, hopefully, make the muscular laguz drop her company member. She smirked, it was ironic that she would be winning Atalantia's favor when the reverse had been the wolf laguz's goal.

Afina focused, and the book began to glow once more, small disks of light and heat radiating from Atalantia's wrists and hip. A slight hiss sounded as the heat seared the laguz's hands, and he cursed (or was it even a growl?) under his breath. Afina squinted, trying to push the magnitude to be hotter and hotter, enough to make the laguz finally release--

From behind, a hand quickly covered her mouth, and Afina gasped as the book fell from her hands. Anneke leaned forward hissing a low "that's enough, don't you think?". The princess shook her head, twisting and struggling against the laguz woman's grip. She kicked her feet, but wasn't close enough to the house to create a noise against the exterior wall. She had to alert her companions somehow, Afina thought, eyes searching for something to make a noise.

An idea struck her, and her hand broke free of the laguz's hold. Afina reached behind her, blindly fumbling, and managed to rip out a chunk of short, black hair from the bandit's head. Anneke growled, shoving Afina roughly against the exterior wall with a thud. Afina gasped as the breath was knocked out of her lungs and a dull pain blossomed along her cheek. She squeezed her eyes shut, hoping her party had noticed the commotion erupting outside.

**Kailyn (John B)** - *2017-12-04*

Being pulled around, shoved and grappled back and forth...Kailyn was enjoying herself too much. She licked her lips as she was tossed prone on the ground, only to be dragged back up.
*sigh*
Nonetheless, this wasn't what was agreed upon, and she must bring up her end of the bargain.

Kailyn begins to morph into her laguz form, struggling to release herself from her breath. The words of "human dog" ring through her ears, giving her a quick idea.
She begins to cry in profuse pain, trying to trick the bandits' souls.

"Is this how you treat your own kind?" Kailyn cried. "I suffered to by the hands of humans, and only seeked shelter. I cry each day and night thinking of the wrongs done to me and my wolf friend. What a world we live in where you can't even trust your fellow laguz!"

As soon as his grip loosens she is going for his throat. Kailyn isn't anyone's bitch.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2017-12-04*

Atalantia was slightly disappointed to discover the true nature of these bandits; she truly hoped that these laguz meant no harm and were wrongfully accussed of being malicious bandits. However, Atalantia was still curious at to why these Laguz have chosen the path of a criminal. 
During her tribal days, she witnessed plenty of other tribes try to steal from her own tribe. However, they only did so in order to survive due to the lack of proper training and pack leaders. It was during this quick reflection that Atalantia became blinded by a bright light.
____

Atalantia's eyes become filled with rage in response to Archaim's words. "I refuse to drop my swords on the ground for the likes of you. I suggest that you put your weapons away if you wish not to face my wrath." It was after this statement that Atalantia became alarmed to notice that her arms began to radiate with a light that was relatively dim. The light had a sense of homely warmth to it, similar to that of the camp fires that Atalantia would sleep next to at night. *This must be the doing of Afina Atalantia thought, perhaps she would give me a chance after all.*Without hesitation, Atalantia takes advantage of Archaim's loosened grip and harshly kicks him forward. After this action, Atalantia quickly transform into her wolf form, slides under Archaim's legs, and transforms rapidly back into human form gracefully placing her blades against the Laguz's neck. "The tables have turned now my friend, you best tell the others to surrender" Atalantia nearly yells as if she was prepared to make a battle cry. 

After yelling, Atalantia's ears twitched as she heard a thud from outside. Atalantia became enraged at the concept that more bandits may be waiting near the exterior of the house possibly harming Afina this very moment. Atalantia was torn between two crucial decisions: should she continue to restrain Archaim with her blades, or should she take the gamble and see if Afina needs her assistance. Either way she was most likely screwed.
