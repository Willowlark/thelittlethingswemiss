**Bill** - *2017-12-21*

Ransford only nods at Elfriede's warning they were about to approach the cabin. He takes the lead from the young knight and draws his blade. The rest of the men fall silent and a energy follows over the group. They're ready for a fight. Once the cabin is in sight, Ransford dismounts and motions for the two of you to stay off to the side as agreed. 

Ransford and his troops move up quickly to the door, Ransford at the door itself. He makes a hand sign and the troops brace themselves before Ransford pulls open the door and they filter inside. You can see activity inside the cabin for a frantic moment before the excitement seems to die down. A few moments more and Ransford comes out of the cabin. He's marching towards you two.

"Faun!" he barks as he gets close. He sounds terribly frustrated. "There was only a single man inside. You had left your wolf ally here correct? Is this not the right place?" he asks. While he is clearly annoyed that things aren't like he was briefed, his asking after Atalantia sounds different, a bit closer to concern. He motions to walk and talk as you join the rest at the cabin.

Inside half a dozen men mill about inspecting the room. Three hold a sole laguz bandit whose in the process of being bound and gagged. A last man has flipped over the coffee table and is looking down the trapdoor you saw when you were first here.

"Sir!" the soldier calls. "You'll want to see this." Ransford jogs over and looks down the trapdoor. He gives a quick order to the man who runs out of the building before turning back to the two of you.

"Were you aware there's more to this complex?" he growls. "That's no hideaway, it's a tunnel leading deeper into who knows where. Did you even clear the room before you left your ally here alone?" The man he sent out comes back in. 

"The bandits have built structures lining the entire cliffside down. That tunnel must serve as the entrance!" he reports. 

"Damnitall, this isn't a tie them up and march them back situation. We've just stepped into their HQ with half the men I'd like to do it!" he shouts. He looks to the two of you before clicking his tongue with an audable *tsk*. "Everyone in. We'll need to clear the place ourselves since our prior intel is useless." The men start scrambling about getting ready.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-21*

He stared back to the captain wide-eyed as his heart skipped a beat and he struggled to find breath.

‚ÄúW-what do you mean noone is there?‚Äù

Elfriede hastily dismounted his steed and rushed over to Ransford. He assumed the only body in the cabin was the unfortunate Lagu boy that had assaulted him earlier which he shook his head at. He didn‚Äôt want to think about that too much. He glanced around desperately looking for some clue, some verification of where they went. 

‚ÄúRansford? They are all gone? Atalantia she--‚Äù Elfriede‚Äôs voice quivered and he bit his tongue hard. He felt like a complete fool. He promised Atalantia that he‚Äôd be back, he promised her that she‚Äôd be okay‚Ä¶ but something didnt add up. Atalantia wouldn‚Äôt have gone dont without a fight. There must be some clue of a scuffle or of a capture. Elfriede glaced around looking for clues again, some trail. He tried to stop his mind from wandering to the place where Atalantia betrayed them. She fought with them with honor. She wouldn't be so quick to betray Afina, her kingdom, her dream was at stake. He gnashed his teeth together and realized his tongue was bleeding slightly from his sharper than normal canine teeth.

He stared at Ransford. ‚ÄúThis is not at all how we left this scene. Some of the Lagu bandits were close to mortally wounded! They couldn‚Äôt have just GOT UP and walked away!‚Äù He realized he was yelling and calmed himself a bit. Is there anything that would point to where they went, where Atalantia is?‚Äù He spun to look at the still mounted Afina wide eyed.

(Soldier informs everyone of the complex)

‚ÄúI...we...I was injured and...I‚Äôm sorry there‚Äôs no excuse, We should have searched more before coming back.‚Äù Elfriede did breathe a sigh of relief that Atalantia didn't betray them,but then quickly felt uneasy all over again as Atalantia was still nowhere to be found.

‚ÄúLady Afina‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sorry, but I guess this trip is going to be delayed further‚Ä¶‚Äù he said defeated.

**Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ )** - *2017-12-22*

As Elfriede leapt from his horse, Afina was still working through her emotions. There were two possibilities: that Atalantia was captured, or that she had defected. And if it was the prior, this whole cabin would have been wrecked in the process. Face still struck with astonishment, she watched as Elfriede paced around, yelling some things at Ransford, who looked similarly as concerned. Odd, Afina thought. She had gotten the impression that Ransford didn't necessarily care about their traveling company, much less a rogue laguz.

Afina dismounted and wandered into the cabin behind the other soldiers. The blood from their original combat was still there, but no other signs of struggle could be seen. Afina knelt down and touched the ground, even using her spell to illuminate the scuffled floor. Distantly, she could hear Ransford lecturing them (mostly Elfriede), but she was more concerned with finding the truth. 

"Everyone in," Ransford commands, and she stands up straight. No signs of struggle. Zero. And entering enemy territory with half as many men as they should have? Any Tyndall tactician would advise against such a strategy. Elfriede starts to apologize, and she quickly cuts him off. "Can I speak with you before we enter enemy territory once more, Elfriede?" She says, nodding towards the door, the tone in her voice making the question seem more like a hesitant command. The slight shake to Afina's voice indicated just as much.
