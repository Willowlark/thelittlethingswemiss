**Bill** - *2018-03-05*

The Kouneli don't notice you as you retreat and head two docks over to the same harbormaster's building you arrived at this afternoon. It's all but fitting that, much like the rest of the docks, the harbormaster's office is light and buzzing with activity. Two captains are drinking over a business transcation in the foyer while another man sorts through paperwork with the clerk at the desk. The harbormaster is the next room over and you can hear voices from his office.

When you enter the clerk waves you into the harbormaster's office, despite it sounding occupied. Following her directions, you find the harbormaster in one of the two guest chairs, sitting across from a man in his mid thirties, dressed in white and purple. Before the foreigners of your party can assume he is a member of the clergy, you take note of the powerful looking sword and shield resting against the man's chair. The soldier has black hair, swept to the side and the only thing untoned on his frame is a subtle jawline. His eyes are a bright green.

"It appears you have work to do friend, let me step outside for some air and I shall see if you aren't busy when I return." the man says, standing up. He quirks an eyebrow at Elfriede, then smiles lightly. He says nothing, only giving a customary salute to a fellow military man. 

The harbormaster gets up slowly and swings around to the other side of the desk. "I remember you lot from this afternoon. What need do you have of me this late in the evening?"

The harbormaster, while clearly a little intoxicated at the start of the conversation, listens quite careful as you describe what you saw. As soon as the last breath of your story is told he shouts "Perrin! Grab Dynskl, rabids trying to overtake The Aster!" and you hear the clatter of a chair and footsteps pounding for the door. 

"Thanks for the information. Lylalel favors the charitable and those who protect her charges." he says quickly before running out of the room himself. You can see through the wide open door and windows the soldier from before with his weapons drawn and the harbormaster behind him, heading to the dock you were just at.

*The name Dynskl clicks in Elfriede's mind. While the young knight had only seen him from afar, there was no way he could forget the name of the Knight's Commander, leader of the Eraia Military. Dynskl Kelrr is the defacto military leader of Eraia and a powerful warrior in his own right. While the church commands the direction of the military, it's Dynskl who actually executes the missions in Lylalel's name.*

**Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ )** - *2018-03-07*

Afina secured her brooch to her travelling cloak, adjusting it in the mirror of her small room at the inn. Their travelling party had elected for seperate rooms in preparation for spending many days in close quarters together. Passage on the boat would be uncomfortable, but the promise of reaching Elfriede‚Äôs residence made her hopeful. She had been curious to see the people that had raised such a dedicated knight. And Elfriede‚Äôs sister, Afina wondered about her as well. Elfriede seemed fond of her; Had Afina missed out by being an only child? 

Afina pulled up her hood, frowned, and then pushed it back off her head. She fidgeted with her hair, half-attempting to style it before giving up. Knowing that the wind off the sea would likely be fierce, the princess opened her pack, searching for a scrap of blue ribbon that she had acquired on their trip to the market. Afina pulled back her hair and secured it with an elegant bow. She turned back to the mirror and nodded, self-assured in beginning their journey.

She stepped out of the room, reconvening with her companions who seemed equally prepared for their endeavor to the shipyard.

The port was once against bustling with activity in the light of day. Though not as lively as the nighttime, sailors hurried to their boats and people bode their relatives farewell. Afina leaned over to look at the paperwork that Elfriede had held onto. ‚ÄúWhere might we find the boat?‚Äù she asked, adjusting the straps on her pack.
