**Bill** - *2017-11-13*

(ooc: Nothing happens on my part.)

**Kailyn (John B)** - *2017-11-16*

Kailyn waited for Elfriede and Afina to be ready, hiding nearby the cabin as she and Atalantia approached the cabin, finally knocking on the door.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-11-16*

*Elfriede sighs again as if a huge burden had just been removed from his not-so-broad shoulders*

**Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ )** - *2017-11-16*

Afina crouched in hiding near Elfriede, nervously thumbing the pages on her book. She gingerly opened the book to a strong offense spell, but hesitated seeing her companions knock on the cabin door. Instead, she flipped to a defensive spell, confident that she would be able to help them should the situation become dire.  She turned to watch the confrontation through the foliage.
