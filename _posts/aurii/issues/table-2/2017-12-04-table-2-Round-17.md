**Bill** - *2017-12-04*

Onfroi grasps at his stomach, doubling over in front of Elfriede. Kailyn's cries ring in his ears but his mind glazes over with a unadulterated rage. His other hand flies forward and grabs Elfriede's left shoulder, throwing all his weight into shoving Elfriede to the floor face first. Onfroi nearly loses his balance doing so, having to step forward before he fell over on Elfriede. 

Onfroi does end up on top of Elfriede, but does so as a massive, brown furred tiger. With paws the size of dinner plates he pins Elfriede to the floor, his forepaws pressing down on Elfriede's shoulders. The growl that follows reverberates through the entire room as his razor sharp teeth approach Elfriede's neck.

In the moment Atalantia is distracted by the sound outside Archaim springs, or rather falls, into action. He stops standing, instead falling into Atalantia behind him which sends both of them to the floor. Archaim barely manages to get his forearms up in time to keep Atalantia's flailing sword arms from removing his limbs. They hit the floor with a crash, all of Archaim's significant weight slamming Atalantia against the floor boards. 

Rather than use the chance to make a pin, Archaim rolls off Atalantia and in the following moment he's in his tiger form. He interposes himself between Atalantia and the door, hindquarters primed and ready to pounce.

"You *bitch*!" Anneke shrieks. She grasps at the back of her hair frantically. "That's the problem with you damn humans. You don't think about anyone but *yourselves*!" She grabs her knife off the ground and pulls Afina to ground by her hair. The cat laguz leaps down, straddling Afina and wielding her knife menacingly.

"You know? I think you could use a haircut too!" she growls, her face calm, focused, and clearly eager to do onto Afina as Afina did to her. 

In the room, Rudi nods when Archaim blocks Atalantia from the door. He sprints across the room, going into a slide as he disappeared under the table.

**Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ )** - *2017-12-04*

Afina glares at Anneke, face tight in a scowl. Years of training had prepared her, as a noble, to defend herself against attackers. She knew (in theory, at least) how to disarm an attacking enemy. Chances of success were low when her own knife was pinned between her back and the ground, uncomfortably jutting into her spine in its sheath. As Anneke leaned towards Afina with the knife, Afina took the chance to confuse her enemy. She headbutted the laguz woman hard, and Anneke shrieked, cradling her head. With her limited range of motion, Afina leapt for the fallen book, trying to read from the offensive spell that it had fallen open to. 

Afina read quickly, the first few words escaping her mouth to create a popping and crackling array of sparks. Anneke grunted as the hot flares sizzled in her face, reaching through them to swipe at Afina. The knife landed at the Laeran‚Äôs wrist, and Afina winced in pain as the book fell from her hands again, and the sparks fizzled out. Afina cradled her wrist with her free hand, as Anneke prepared to jab once more. 

The laguz lunged, and Afina hit hard and fast into the woman‚Äôs wrist with her free hand. The knife fell with a soft thud into the grass as Anneke staggered, the red on the blade glistening in the sunlight. Afina leapt to her feet, taking the opportunity to unsheath her own dagger. The laguz‚Äôs eyes went wide for a moment, before shifting into a sinister glare. From her hunched over position, Anneke snarled, appearance shifting to change into her animal form. Afina backed away, searching for a way to counter her attacker.

‚ÄúNot so useful without your book,‚Äù Anneke said calmly, the phrase punctured by growling and bared teeth. 

Afina‚Äôs hand shook as it held the knife. Tyndalls didn‚Äôt kill. They used diplomacy up until the last possible second before war. She didn‚Äôt want to kill this woman, though the other was likely very prepared to kill _her_ if need be. From the corner of her eye, the letters of the open book shimmered in the sunlight. Afina, once again, had a crack shot plan.

As Anneke dove for Afina‚Äôs throat, the princess dove to the side, tucking and rolling to grab her book. The heavy, leather-bound spell book felt surprisingly heavy in her hands for the first time since she had started spell-casting. She sheathed the knife, and instead held the book with both hands, scarlet blood cascading down her left arm. Anneke growled once more, and Afina levelled her gaze with the laguz. ‚ÄúI know you do this to survive. So I do not blame you for your actions. But you have hurt too many innocent to walk free. Come quietly, and I promise you will meet fair and reasonable trial at the hands of the Laeran council. The laguz are treated with open arms and open minds in Laera. You don‚Äôt have to do this.‚Äù 

A sliver of hesitance flickered in Anneke‚Äôs eyes, but it was quickly snuffed out by white hot anger seconds later. The laguz lunged, and with a flinch, Afina brought the book down hard on her head. With a whimper, Anneke went limp. Afina stood over her body, book raised once more in a defensive posture. Eyes closed, the woman didn‚Äôt stir. With an exhale, she lowered the book, glancing over the cut on her left arm. Afina poked it, and winced as it stung. 
Suddenly, she remembered that her companions were still inside. Afina dashed to the front, book open to a defensive spell, and threw open the front door.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-04*

Elfriede is dazed again as yet another strike to his head lands. Struggling again to hold onto consciousness he remembers that the tiger man had just begun transforming and rolls onto his back. Elfriede recalls his training in dealing with beast form lagu and quickly wraps his deceptively tough cloak around his neck to help stop his attacker‚Äôs teeth from gripping and getting a death blow on him.

The lagu in its blind rage then jumped onto the boy pinning him and blasting all the air out of his lungs. Desperately gasping for air Elfriede struggles to cover his neck with his arm. He feels warm liquid running down his side and pooling up around him. He winces thinking himself mortally wounded but something felt off. 

Faun glanced up to the rapier still sticking out of the lagus chest and the beast above him fast losing consciousness. He reaches for his rapier as the heavy lagu collapses on top of him blasting all his air out again. 

Elfriede felt his tail throb with searing heat again under his body as the pain shot up his spine. 

He heard a shriek outside that was clearly Afina. *His charge!*
But, Elfriede hadnt the strength to move the tiger off of him...

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2017-12-05*

Atalantia was very disappointed in herself to let Archaim knock her down. Perhaps this is a sign that Atalantia was becoming weaker due to several days of not training. Perhaps once this mission is over, she can train with the others? 

Atalantia then recomposed herself, and kept careful watch on Archaim who was blocking the door to Afina. Atalantia greatly wished to ensure that the princess was safe, however she had an even greater concern in mind.  While keeping an eye on Archaim, Atalantia also directed her attention towards Elfriede who seems to be in critical condition. 
Atalantia has thinks to herself, *"How can you possibly expect to protect Afina, if you can't seem to protect yourself Elfriede. Although to be fair, I suppose the knights may not be used to the Laguz ways of combat. Regardless, Elfriede is one of my teammates; It shall be my duty to protect him along with the others, before it shall be my duty to ensure my own safety alone"*

After her mental debate, Atalantia first directs her attention towards Archaim who is blocking the main door to Afina. At this very moment,  the dire situation of Elfriede grasping for life, and K sobbing on the ground reminds Atalantia of the time in which her two younger siblings where caught off guard by humans who eventually massacred them. 
This flashback enraged Atalantia; she determined that her party was like family, and at this current moment the party appears to be as defenseless as her deceased siblings. Because of this, she would not allow her party to be killed by such pathetic low lifes. 
Through rage, Atalantia lunges towards archaim first starting with a leg sweap so that Archaim falls harshly towards the ground. Next, Atalantia  takes a swing at both of Archaims legs; She focuses her strike on the Peroneal nerve, which is in charge of controlling movement in the lower leg. Such a tactic would be used when hunting large bears during her tribal days, so that they would be weakened and easier to kill.
However, Atalantia refused to kill this laguz, instead seeking a sort of sadistic enjoyment of impairing the Laguz's walking forever. She would not become the same type of low life that killed her siblings.

Once achieving this devastating blow to Archaim's Peroneal nerve, Archaim screams in agony as his legs profusely bleed out.
Atalantia then loudly and bluntly proclaims, "Don't you dare ever take advantage of my family. I gave you all the benefit of the doubt and you did nothing but prove yourself to be mear animals. You aren't Laguz, you ARE Beasts. I cannot allow any of you to represent my kind. None of you deserve to walk out of this location unscathed."

Atalantia then runs to Elfriede's side, with several tears in her eyes. She was not just the tough Laguz wolf everyone assumes she is. 
Atalantia proceeds to push the tiger laguz body off of Elfriede with all her might and anguish. Once this is achieved, Atalantia's motherly instinct goes into play. The sight of Elfriede's managled body reminds her yet again of her massacred siblings, whose limbs were just as mutilated. Blood rushes to Atalantia's face as she begins to rip off pieces of her tunic. After much of her tunic is torn, Atalantia continues to wrap Elfriede's wounds in hopes to stop any critical bleeding. Tears begin to stream down Atalantia's face.
