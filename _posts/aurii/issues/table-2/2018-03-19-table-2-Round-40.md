The sailors of the Aster are held in check by the mast-men running amuck about the ship. The best the men can do is keep the Kouneli from getting below deck where they could do more damage. Neither the captain of the Aster or the enemy ship is easy to spot.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-03-19*

Elfriede winced as he knew what this would come to. He jerked his weapons downwards while fighting against the force of the women above him. The weapons slid down the hilt to where the handle was made of wood. Elfriede‚Äôs razor sharp blades bit through it and he finished the motion of the cross, double slashing the females throat above him. He dodged the falling axe head as blood poured out of her new wound onto him. She reached up for her throat and Elfriede tore free and kicked her off. He looked at her with remorse, he always hated when it came to this. Best not to let her suffer. Faun leaned forward and stabbed her quickly into her chest through the vital.

‚ÄúMay Lylalel guide you.‚Äù 

He had no time to wallow over yet another life, there were far too many enemies for that. Elfriede stood up quickly and glanced over to the plank he was just on, which was now aflame. He looked right through a small group of four pirates to see that they were still coming over the one plank unchallenged. 

‚ÄúI better challenge them I suppose.‚Äù He said to himself before he sprinted off towards the group. *There were too many‚Ä¶ he‚Äôd be hard pressed to beat them back without a few deaths‚Ä¶ He‚Äôd have to‚Ä¶*

Faun approached one from behind with a hard thrust through the chest. *Three.* He high kicked the pirate into another and yanked his rapier out. As they all turned Faun approached a lagu male to his left, dropped, and swept their legs out with his right leg. His dagger came up into the back of the pirates neck as he fell. *Two* 

Elfriede felt like he was running out of breath and his arms felt numb from the clashing of weapons, but he couldn‚Äôt let up. One of the pirates came at his low form with a shield and mace in retaliation. He rolled right as the mace came down hard, hitting the wall of the ship with the bottom of his boots. He pushed off the wall hard and the wall creaked loudly in response. Faun hit the pirate shoulder first and checked the swinging pirate over the side of the railing. *One* He stood back up as again a young male stared at him holding a dagger shaking while frowning in disbelieve. He came at Elfriede in random swings, this kid was a mess. Faun knocked the boy‚Äôs dagger out of his hand into the waters below and moved forward.

‚ÄúEnough.‚Äù Faun brought his knee up hard in the gut knocking the wind out of the boy. ‚ÄúThis isn't how you get your way Kouneli.‚Äù He truly felt sorry for the boy, clearly carried astray by the radical beliefs of these pirates. Faun glanced over to a nearby closet, knocked the boy unconscious with a blow to the back of the head and threw him in there. He‚Äôd deal with that one later. 

Several more pirates came over the plank. Faun shut the closet door and winced when he noticed. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve wasted to much time already.‚Äù He moved towards the plank to reenter the fray.

**Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ )** - *2018-03-21*

A sudden fireball blasted against Afina‚Äôs makeshift shield, and she was thrown backwards. The princess landed on her back with a _thunk_, the heavy wood hitting her chest and knocking the wind out of her. Afina coughed, pushing the shield off of her and sitting up. _Fine,_ Afina thought, still coughing as she crouched behind the railing of the ship. _I‚Äôll deal with you mages later_. After all, the fireproof nature of the ship‚Äôs wood would hold them at bay for at least a little while. If they started to target the sails or cargo, there would be issues. But Afina had to assist the sailors on the Aster before she could make any more headway with the enemy mages. There was simply too much going on to target them effectively. 

Afina hurried down the stairs to the main platform, clutching her book tightly in her arms. Her sword bounced in its sheath at her side, ready to be drawn should she need it. An enemy pirate moved to challenge Afina as she descended from the upper deck, catching her halfway down the stairs. 

As he raised his sword towards her, Afina caught him in the eyes with flash of light, and the pirate dropped his weapon. The laguz fighter growled, tears welling in his blinded eyes as he fumbled to grab Afina. The princess shrieked, batting at the Kouneli‚Äôs arms with her book. The furious laguz grasped the heavy leather spellbook, and Afina yanked back, the two engaged in a tugging match. A sudden thought struck Afina. The laguz was still recovering from her spell; his balance was vastly uncoordinated. If she could just...

Afina gave one last pull at the book, before letting go entirely, and kicking her foot forward. As if on cue, the laguz man pulled back, and was shocked to meet no resistance as Afina let go. He wobbled on the edge of the steps, and the force of Afina‚Äôs kick send him tumbling down. Afina trailed behind him, gracefully descending the rest of the stairs before stooping over to pick up her book.  _Stupid laguz_, she thought, stepping around the rabbit laguz‚Äôs unconscious body. 

Facing the battle, Afina had not registered the awkward angle that the pirate‚Äôs neck was contorted at, his unseeing eyes dimly pointed skyward. She had eliminated a threat, that was all. To what extent, however, she was not yet aware of. 

Afina froze as she finally spotted Elfriede, the Eraian knight leaned forward to stab a laguz woman in the chest. The princess‚Äô breath caught in her throat as the woman slumped over, and Elfriede gently laid her back on the floor. Afina studied his face; _May Lylalel guide you_, he mouthed, hesitating only for a moment before returning to the fray. Her stomach churned and her face grew pale as her gaze froze on the woman‚Äôs body, abruptly turning away when she felt she had seen too much. _The front lines was no place for a princess_, she thought, turning her face towards the rest of the fighters on the main deck.

Blood spattered across the floorboards in all directions, smudged and smeared where men had continued their skirmish from the ground. An Eraian sailor hit the deck a few paces ahead of her, and Afina grasped her book tighter, knuckles turning white. In an instant the pirate‚Äôs assailant was engulfed in a purifying beam of light that seemed to materialize from the very sky itself. The laguz soon joined his recent kill on the deck of the Aster. Remembering Elfriede‚Äôs actions of not moments before, Afina lowered her book, anxiously thumbing the pin that bore her family‚Äôs sigil. ‚ÄúMay Lylalel guide you,‚Äù she whispered, hoping that, despite her own lack of faith, her gesture may help the sailor in whatever way it can.  

Afina realigned her sights to the enemy mages once more, secretly hoping to engage in a much‚Ä¶ cleaner form of combat than swordfighting. The princess was not one in particular for spilling blood. Perhaps this very fact was why the Laeran favored light magic above all.
