**Bill** - *2017-12-28*

"Use the cover yourself you daft fools, a shield can't protect you forever!" Ransford barks. His own weapons are drawn, a large shield and an equally large sword. The blade is large for a one handed sort and nicked heavily; it's clearly custom made for the Commander. His troops follow his orders, half of them going for cover themselves and drawing bows from their backs. As the bowmen begin to trade arrows back and forth Ransford and the other half of his soldiers step into the fray.

Ransford steps up to a tiger laguz wielding a longsword with two hands. The Commander marches straight up to the laguz and rather than swing his blade he swipes his shield forward and out, forcing the tiger's sword up and away from him. Ransford then does a cross body slash that cuts across the laguz's legs. A cat laguz jumps at him from the side with two daggers. Ransford steps backwards with one foot, sinking into a lunge with his shield forward. The kneeling posture lets his shield cover more of his body and the daggers click uselessly against the worn metal. 

Ransford steps to his full height as the cat takes a leap backwards. Ransford steps forward this time slashing wide and just barely missing the bandit. His shield arm goes up again, blocking a swing from the tiger he slashed earlier. Ransford pivots to face the tiger, parrying another swing of the longsword before kicking the man's injured thighs. The tiger laguz falls to his knees and Ransford thrusts his blade into his shoulder. The man falls prone, and his sword clatters against the wood floor, not before Ransford pivoted back to the cat laguz with the daggers.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-28*

Faun had never seen anything quite like that spell, even during his time among the clergy caster branch of the military, which wasn‚Äôt too surprising. A lot of solo light mage‚Äôs spells that are not among the clergy are unique; the clergy is a place of practice and ritual but as a result a lot of the spells are rather similar. Afina‚Äôs spell was unique to her, you can feel that she poured herself into it. Elfriede was rather impressed by the display.

Just then, he watched as a bandit broke ranks to charge Afina. The boy winced as she withdrew her dagger from its sheath, hoping silently to Lylalel that she knew how to use that thing.
In the barrage of arrows that followed, Faun watched as several of the bandits in the rooms were shot, downing many, some fatal. 

He took careful note of Ransfords current movements and position. His title was rightly earned, but Faun couldn't help but think that if he wasn‚Äôt so gruff he would have made it so much further. Overall the situation was well in hand. These untrained bandits were being decimated by these trained soldiers and Afina‚Äôs casting.

Just then, a dual short sword wielding young man wearing a fur tunic jumped out of the shadows to engage Elfriede. He came at him with a false vertical slash and deftly switched to a dual low stab. Elfriede couldn‚Äôt believe the boys speed he barely saw him switch. As if instincts alone were guiding Elfriede, he back-stepped and double slash-parried downward knocking the boys swords down just out of reach. Cold sweat began to gather; that was *way* too close.

This boy was clearly going to take some time to bring down, but it was time Elfriede didn‚Äôt have. He was currently transfixed on the Lagu engaging Afina in melee. He wanted to reposition to defend Afina. Elfriede thought that the soldier‚Äôs wall would be enough to keep them away from her. Trying to stop his mind from wandering to the dark place wear Afina is brought down after all that has happened today, he knew that he couldn‚Äôt just disengage this one.

Slowly, he moved his dagger hand behind his back, pointed the rapier toward his target and turned his body sideways in typical duelist fashion. Faun slowed his breath as he was taught and readied himself for his counter-heavy fighting style. The laguz rushed him with a spinning slash with both weapons. Elfriede‚Äôs sword came across knocking one aside and then pivoted, bringing his dagger around to clash against the other. With a twist Elfriede threw one of the boys swords sliding across the floor. Elfriede then went low, wrapped his arm arm the boys free arm and shoulder threw the him across the room toward the bandit engaging Afina, landing short into some barrels. Elfriede swiftly rushed him giving almost no recovery time and went on the offensive, prodding the boy for an opening with his rapier. Combinations of slashing and thrusting attacks were knocked aside by the combatant. Elfriede kept pushing him back until they began to near where Afina was being engaged. *Elfriede felt he had to do something soon.* He didn't trust that Afina would last long in melee combat, he feared for her.
A flash of light went off and he suddenly pivoted in the middle of his string of attacks and kicked the laguz hard up and over a crate. during that brief moment he looked over to Afina who was looking up at him and he winced at the blood smeared across her face. A moment later the bandit was back up now holding a long sword in his off-hand that he retrieved from another fallen soldier.

**Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ )** - *2017-12-28*

Knife against knife, it was clear the laguz boy had not been formally trained in knife fighting. He jabbed at awkward angles, attacking more out of determined anger than practiced strategy. Afina blocked each swing; she hit his forearm here, jabbed his elbow there. And still the laguz male attacked with vicious prejudice, teeth barred in anger. He jabbed forward, slashing at Afina‚Äôs chest, and her knife met his with a metallic clang. The force shook Afina‚Äôs grip, but she held on tight, her bright blue eyes meeting the wild brown ones of her attacker. Out of her peripheral vision, Afina saw Elfriede engage in combat with a dual-wielding bandit, and she made a quick mental note of where he was positioned.

In her moment of hesitation, the bandit landed a swift kick to Afina‚Äôs torso, knocking the air out of her lungs. She doubled over with a gasp, and the bandit swung at her once more. Afina reacted quickly, dropping to her knees and slashing at the bandit‚Äôs legs. The knife made contact, but only just barely, ripping the thigh fabric of his pants and drawing blood. Afina herself was surprised that she had managed to land a hit, eyebrows raised in shock.

The bandit made a noise somewhere between a growl and yell, dropping his weapon to grab Afina by the back of her hair, and bringing his knee into her face hard. Pain splintered through Afina‚Äôs nose, and she held her face in agony, her hand coming back coated in bright red. The bandit released her to retrieve his weapon, and in a daze, Afina shakily got back to her feet. Afina held out her dagger with one hand, as the other hand attempted to stifle the blood flowing from her nose, the scarlet red now cascading down her arm. She glanced at Elfriede, still engaged with his combatant, closer now. 

This time, the dagger didn‚Äôt shake as Afina held it firmly in her hands. Tyndalls didn‚Äôt kill, that much was still true. But the animalistic behavior that she had witnessed in her attacker infuriated her. This was his last chance. ‚ÄúThis is your final chance at repentance, come peacefully, and you will treated with fairness in the eyes of the law,‚Äù Afina said firmly, still stemming her nosebleed. The bandit boy chuckled in response, his voice surprisingly young. How old was he, she thought. ‚ÄúYou think I would surrender to the likes of _you_? When I have the advantage?‚Äù he shook his head. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre dumber than you look.‚Äù

Afina‚Äôs eyes flashed with anger. Dumb? _DUMB_? ‚ÄúVery well then, attack me if you dare, you filthy beast,‚Äù she declared, glaring. The laguz lunged, seemingly transforming in mid-air. Afina evaded to the side, diving for her book that had landed with pages open on the floor. She exhaled in relief as she felt the crinkled pages meet her finger tips. 

The tiger that had been a man mere seconds before turned to face Afina, snarling, and immediately his body was consumed in a bright, white light. Laying across the floor, Afina had projected a single beam of light, flowing from her outstretched palm. The force of the blast sent air whistling through the small atrium, whipping Afina‚Äôs blonde hair into her face, the light locks stained red with the blood smeared across her cheek. The laguz howled and whimpered in pain, only the black outline of his tiger form visible as he writhed in the white beam. 

Afina closed her first, and the beam faded, revealing the wolf laguz collapsed on the floor. She sighed in relief. Climbing back to her feet, she suddenly locked eyes with Elfriede across the room, whose face conveyed a mix of concern and surprise. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm alright,‚Äù Afina called, wiping away the last of the blood from her nose with a small smile. The streaks of drying blood on her cheek and arm were a _clear_ indicator to Elfriede that she could handle herself, Afina thought sarcastically. But at least she had pulled off yet _another_ advanced light magic spell. She had been sent from home to 'become learned'; Maybe this was it. Afina rolled her shoulders, readying herself for more combatants with an exhale.
