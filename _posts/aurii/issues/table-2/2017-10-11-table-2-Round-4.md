**Bill** - *2017-10-11*

Itory take the letter from Efreide before stepping back to the front side of Afina' desk. With practiced motions he grabs the letter opener from the desk without taking his eye from his lady and the guests. He opens the envelope and confirms the letter is clear of any suspicious properties before giving it to Afina to read.

```
Dear Lady Tyndall, Princess of Laera of the Callorian Alliance,

My name is Morras Raive, Cardinal of Trisp. Your professor and our mutual friend Carya Witella has written me that despite the political challenges you wish to visit my city and learn about Lylalel's magic from those who understand it best. I do not boast when I say no other church nor study knows light magic the way we do here. 

I respect Carya Witella and given his earnest request I brought it to those who can allow a Callorian noble's presence into glorious Eraia. I am pleased to inform you enclosed in this letter are papers that will allow you to travel through Eraia to Trisp. While we cannot allow you to study with us formally, a cultural visit is welcome. We hope that after visiting with us you will take your newfound knowledge of Lylalel's light back to your home; for we want no misconceptions as to the source of the light magics you wish to use. 

As a wise youth, I am sure you noted the unusual curior for this message. Knight-Lieutenant Elfreide Faun comes highly recommended by a personal friend in the military. I asked my friend to provide a trusted Eraian escort for you in the off chance you encounter trouble on the road, Lylalel forbid you trouble in your travels either politically or criminal. I expected a group only to hear back that Knight-Lieutenant Elfreide would do the job better than any other. His orders detailing this objective are also enclosed, do pass them to him. If you wish to bring a few people of your own with you we understand your trepidation. So long as your party remains small the papers I've enclosed shall cover you and yours. 

Sincerely,

Morras Raive, Cardinal of Trisp.

Each of the documents Cardinal Morras mentioned are present in the envelope, each adorned with an official seal.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-10-11*

*He looks to Itory and nods and then steps forward to take the letter.*

*after reading the letter for himself he lets out a chuckle*

‚ÄúSending me is starting to make some sense now.‚Äù

*He looks back to Afina and offers another practiced bow* 

‚ÄúWell it seems I'm to do your bidding and Guard you from all harm Lady Afina. I seems as though I'll be in pleasant company indeed for my trip back. Might I suggest setting out in the morn after you‚Äôve gathered your things? Although I suppose if I am to stay might I ask to borrow a guest room for the night?‚Äù

*After Afina's Response Elfriede grumbles in his head a bit about the others coming along and sighs ever so slightly under his breathe. He's going to have to spend more time with that Lylallel forsaken Cat girl..*

**Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ )** - *2017-10-11*

1. Afina nodded at her guests respectfully, before taking the letter from Itory. She skimmed over it briefly, only if to confirm that it held what she thought it did, and passed it back. She hesitated, trying to remember what her father said when they received a visitor to their home. ‚ÄúWelcome, valued guests. I‚Äôm glad after so much time spent travelling that you have all made it to your‚Ä¶ destination safely.‚Äù She cleared her throat, lacing her fingers together. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll admit I‚Äôm surprised to have visitors for me specifically, people often come to this tower in search of my father. I guess the assumption is that the head of the Tyndall family would reside here, rather than his daughter.‚Äù She laughs softly, almost awkwardly. Receiving guests was her least favorite duty as a noble.

2. She turned to her first guest. ‚ÄúKnight-Lieutenant Elfriede, thank you for delivering such an important message. I‚Äôve been waiting for these documents for a while now. I would be glad to travel back to Eraia under your protection.‚Äù She turned to her butler. ‚ÄúItory, please send immediate word to my family that I will be departing in the morning,‚Äù she said with a nod. ‚ÄúAs for your request of food and lodging, we can surely accommodate. Tyndall Tower was intended for family retreats, and surely has extra bed space somewhere. We will leave as soon as I am packed with a full night‚Äôs rest, of course.‚Äù

3. Afina then focused on the wolf laguz. ‚ÄúMy second guest, I‚Äôm impressed to hear that you‚Äôve travelled so far on your own! Though I do believe I‚Äôve neglected to hear your name. What may I call you? Also‚Ä¶‚Äù Afina hesitates, glancing down and twiddling her thumbs together, before looking back up to address Atalantia. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid I cannot at the moment offer you what you‚Äôre looking for. I‚Äôm sure you already know that the Symbol of Alliance isn‚Äôt something a family bestows freely. For the Tyndall family especially, it isn‚Äôt easily garnered, but it isn't impossible to receive, however‚Ä¶‚Äù she hesitated, drumming her fingers on the desk. ‚ÄúThough if you were to travel in my company back to Eraia, there may be a chance for us to forge a very strong bond in the process. I make no promises, but I ask, how am I able to give you my seal of approval without even knowing who I am?‚Äù

She takes a deep breath, before smiling and nodding. ‚ÄúI am able to provide you as well with lodging and food for the night, as I know you‚Äôve travelled very far. I anticipate an answer for my proposal by the morning.‚Äù

4. Finally, Afina addresses her final guest, nodding in acknowledgement. ‚ÄúWelcome to my tower, K. I‚Äôm glad to see another person with such zest for learning so far away from home! I‚Äôve missed that zealous enthusiasm that is so prevalent in Laera. Though, I am confused as to why you‚Äôve travelled to me of all people for knowledge in the arcane arts. I may be the king‚Äôs daughter, and thereby equipped with the finest books, but surely the libraries of Laera would be of more help to you‚Ä¶‚Äù she said, furrowing her brows. ‚ÄúNonetheless, it would discourteous of me to turn down an anxious pupil. If you so wish to learn from me, I invite you to travel with me to Eraia as well, and I can teach you what I know in our travels. I will provide food and a bed overnight for you as well, and anticipate an answer by morning.‚Äù

**Kailyn (John B)** - *2017-10-15*

*Kailyin didn't know what to think about this situation. Well she over-estimated the difficulty of it, that's for certain, but to be taught by a princess instead of a sage or proper mage. Is this a better situation? How much does she know? Where will she be departing to in Eraia?*

*She sighs from the thought of all the questions racing in her mind. Everything happened much faster than she anticipated.*

"Thank you for your offer princess," she states, calmly,  "and to be honest I am quite surprise. Although I am not one to say no to adventure, I was hoping you'd refer me to a sage or teacher to learn advanced magic that you may not even know. Also, if I am to accompany you, why will you be heading to Eraia?"

She pauses for a second and gives another sigh, "It is not my attention to be rude by your offer, and although I don't intend to sit around I believe that a teacher may help me, and help me help you in your task, even more."

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2017-10-16*

In an embarrassed tone, Atalantia finally introduces herself, "Oh I am terribly sorry, I assumed I had already provided my name. You may call me Atalantia."

Atalantia then goes on to answer Afina's other statements
"perhaps you have mistaken me for a fool, for I know a symbol of alliance is not an easy one to obtain. It is true that an alliance will be hard to forge with one I do not know the nature of, However I was given a challenge and I am prepared to do what is necessary in order to complete it.  After all, the concept of challenges and proving my worth is no new concept for me. 

I will also gladly accept your offer of food and shelter, as long as I may be able to accompany you back to Eraia"
