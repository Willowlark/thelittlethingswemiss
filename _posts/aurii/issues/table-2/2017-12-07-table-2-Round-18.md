The wooden table suddenly shoots upward, clattering over to one side. More laguz bandits come climbing up a trapdoor that was beneath the table, clearly warned of your intrusion. They branch off to Kailyn on the floor, Atalantia kneeling over the downed Elfriede and Afina in the doorway, each armed and ready for a battle. 

(ooc: They're mooks, so you can write for the lot of them.)

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-07*

Elfriede world still spinning felt the great weight lifted off of him. He glanced up to Atalantia who was already bandaging his wounds. His wounds‚Ä¶ his wounds! 

*Elfriede sits up slowly and is shocked to see him new companion crying over him, she barely knows him. Elfriede gently stops Atalantia from further bandaging him and respectfully looks away from her torn tunic*

*Elfriede smiles* ‚ÄúThank you, I‚Äôm okay... really, please you don't need to bandage my wounds any further, most of this blood isn't even mine. I just have some joint damage and a really bad headache.‚Äù 
*He stares at her truly concerned over her sudden emotional state*
‚ÄúI just might need a shoulder to lean on for our way back.‚Äù
*More banging is heard beneath them.*
*He glances over at the trap door opening and grabs his nearby weapons*

*Elfriede slowly stands on weak legs and steadies his weapons as more laguz burst through*

His footwork won‚Äôt help him on unsteady legs but these Lagu looked far less trained, Elfriede felt that he could take them even in this state.

*Some of the Lagu rush him and Atalantia. One young cat male coming up for a flank brandishing two sharp knives smiling confidently as he eyed Elfriede in his sorry state*

He dove in one knife cutting low at Faun‚Äôs side and one poised for the throat. The Lagu‚Äôs look went from confident to shock when he heard metal twice and his arms flew outward. Elfriede‚Äôs parries resonated his blades loudly only being silenced as his rapier went through the knee of the Lagu. He would normally kick the boy to knock him off balance and force a surrender, but his balance was way off and he realized he couldn't pull that off. He had to end it. 

Elfriede spun his left hand and reversed the grip driving his dagger begrudgingly into the catboys throat. 

He pulls both blades free as the knives dropped.

‚Äú*sigh* One at a time‚Ä¶‚Äù He said lethargically. Although he knew that his comanions had this fight well under control. *He snickered a bit to himself.* Except maybe Kailyn. Maybe in her own way.

*the thought was cut short by waves of nausea from his head injuries*

**Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ )** - *2017-12-07*

Afina freezes in the doorway, stupefied by the scene in front of her. Witty and charismatic Kailyn, hunched over on the ground in defeat. Strong and fierce Atalanta, collapsed on the floor in tears. Noble and steadfast Elfriede sprawled on the ground, covered in‚Ä¶ blood!? Afina blinked, unsure what to make of the situation. This outcome didn‚Äôt line up with her preconceived notions of her company‚Äôs fighting ability. She clenched her hand around her book. Tyndalls were very sensitive about their tactician skills; it came from her mother‚Äôs side. And to think that Afina had never wanted to come to the bandit hideout to begin with! She clenched her teeth. At least the situation was over with. She could relax knowing they would soon be on their way back to--

Suddenly, the table in the room toppled over, revealing a trapdoor beneath it. The latch swung open, and more bandits poured out from beneath the floor. Elfriede slowly, weakly, got to his feet, as Atalantia wiped her eyes and prepared for combat. Not this _dumb_ feculence again! The annoyances from their travels had been mounting. Losing her authority and respect, disappointing superiors, making the wrong decisions. And now, Afina remembered as blood dribbled down her arm and her cheek radiated pain, _now_ she had been assaulted, only to have to fight more enemies! As a noble, Afina had been taught to keep a level head. Tyndalls used diplomacy up until the last possible second before--

But the princess had reached her limit, flipping to a new page as more laguz bandits rushed her. Afina began to read, one hand holding the book open as another pointed at the bandits. Light began to collect in her palm, bright in comparison to the fast-approaching night time of the world outside of the cabin. Afina was yelling as she read by now, both out of anger and out of desire to be heard over the clanging of metal against metal. As she read the last word to the spell, there was a split second of hesitation as one laguz bandit dared to charge directly at Afina, raising his blade and licking his lips. 

Afina spared but a second to glare at him, before light erupted from her palm, radiating outward in all directions. A flicker of apprehension rippled through her mind, realizing that, this time, she had neglected to warn her companions of the light. But she pressed onwards, hearing the shrieks and groans of the bandits as they were seared by the heat and blinded by the light. Though blinded by anger, a small part of her hoped that her companions felt no such pain. The effects of the spell relied heavily on the caster‚Äôs intent. And while she was very much irritated with how events had played out because of them, she would never wish to harm them directly.

The light faded out, revealing a more chaotic scene than there bad been before the light erupted. Afina sighed, more relaxed now that she had taken her frustrations out on her spellcasting, lowering the book in her left hand and unsheathing a dagger with her right. Tyndalls didn‚Äôt like resorting to violence, but Afina‚Äôs mental fatigue made it difficult to focus on any other high-level spell. The enemies that hadn‚Äôt been incapacitated by the spell were to be dealt with swiftly. 

Afina was shocked out of her fatigue as she heard a loud wince from nearby. She turned her head, only to see Elfriede retrieve his dagger from the throat of a bandit. Blood cascading from the wound, and Afina frowned in distaste. She hated violence, but Elfriede was a noble just as she was. He must‚Äôve thought the action absolutely necessary. Afina gasped in surprised as Elfriede hesitated, swaying slightly. She didn‚Äôt see where all the blood had come from, but the injury must‚Äôve been severe. She dashed over to him, knowing she would need an ally among all these laguz. She put a hand on his shoulder, ‚ÄúAre you alright?‚Äù

**Kailyn (John B)** - *2017-12-11*

Kailyn goes over to Atalantia.

"Hey, you should let them capture me. Let's see where they would take us." Kailyn gives a wink and smile. She refues to acknowledge the last 12 minutes.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2017-12-11*

Atalantia recomposes herself relatively fast; Her frustration was subsiding. Atalantia nods in response to Elfriede's gratitude, "I will always be willing to help those I consider to be one of my own"

It's was at this moment that Atalantia heard the sound of a click. The laguz criminals did have something more to hide. Atalantia braced herself to finish of the rest of the criminals with her Allies. 

Atalantia looks over quickly to K who mutters something along of the lines of letting her teammates be taken. Atalantia refuses to fully acknowledge this statement, wanting to even the playing field a bit. 

Atalantia rushes into combat, but shortly after Afina seems to have used some of her light magic, which blinds Atalantia for a moment. During this time Atalantia became atune to her surroundings, she listened and waited carefully in order to avoid any attacks. Once her vision began to clear, Atalantia started to attack the laguz criminals. Similar to the last Laguz she fought, she refused to kill these Laguz in this moment. Instead she began to severe their limbs, specifically the legs, waiting for them to hit the floor crying. Atalantia aimed to inflict more long-standing pain than a short and simple death. 
After slicing the legs of the laguz criminals, Atalantia stood in the center watching all of them fall to the floor crying until they lost enough blood to pass out.

Now it seems like the only thing to do would to be to wait for some reinforcements to handle these criminals. Unless there was more up these bandits sleeves, there should be nothing else to fear.
