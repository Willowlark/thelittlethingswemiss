**Bill** - *2017-10-23*

As you come close to the guard house half a dozen of the men charge out and form a half circle in front of your group. 

"Hold! Who are you and what brings you through to Eraia?" One shouts. The group of soldiers tighten up as he yells. A new soldier comes up from behind the group, an older man wearing pieces of heavy armor with dents in it and with a scruffy mustache. He looks over your group quickly then taps the soldier who spoke on the shoulder.

"Stand down boys, that's one of ours. An Eraian Knight-Lieutenant wouldn't be traveling with bandits." he says with a gruff voice.

"But sir, what if that's not his uniform?" the soldier from before asks without taking his eyes of Elfreide.

"A good thought my boy, but I can vouch for Sir Elfreide. He passed through this very station a week ago." the man says with a chuckle in his voice. He gives a nod to Elfreide acknowledging the fellow soldier. The leader's men set their spears down and visibly relax. "The lot of you can head back to the station, I'll handle the rest." he says. They each give a short bow and say *"In the service of Lylalel"* quietly. He nods back and says *"May she guide you"*. The remaining soldier walks up closer to them.

"I'm Ransford Gale, commander of this garrison. I apologize for the hostile response." he says, bowing in the direction of the two women. "There's been trouble with a group of laguz bandits recently, just over a day ago a caravan carrying some ancient texts was attacked and looted. We can't be too careful out here." He stops for a moment, realizing something. "Ah, not to worry about it miladies." he adds. "They've yet to harass anyone outside a trade caravan. Additionally you've mostly past their active area; the last path into that section of the woods is naught but a mile from here."

He clears his throat. "Right then, we've held you up long enough and my story telling won't get you where you're going. Follow me over to the station and we'll check out those papers, though I don't expect anything to be out of order." he says. As he leads you towards the station he turns to Elfreide specifically. "I know not your itinerary, and you clearly have business to be done, but get you the chance tell someone from the church we've figure out where these bandits have holed up. Manpower's been scarce with the Drecian conflict and all that, but if they can spare a group for just a day we'll be able to drive them off." 

Sitting down on the other side of a small counter in the center of the station, he picks up a quill and smiles. "Now then, pass me the paperwork to read, I'll answer any questions ya have, and we won't hold you up any longer."

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-10-23*

*Initially lost in thought about family and tradition from his conversation with Afina Elfriede had to snap himself out of it when they approached the guards*

*Elfriede initially tenses thinking something had happened and then releases once the commander calmed the troops*

*he does a slight bow to the Commander*

‚ÄúHahaha, I know my party is a bit strange this time upon returning to Eraia, but the Laguz came on the word of my escortee and I had no reason to deny her. I understand the response but no trouble was caused so no harm done and I thank you for your kindness.‚Äù

*Elfriede glances back to the party*

‚ÄúI mean‚Ä¶ hmm‚Ä¶ *Elfriede pauses for a moment* I‚Äôd normally offer assistance, but I don't want to deny my orders to return the Lady. I‚Äôll be sure to let them know of the situation when we arrive in the capitol. Does anyone else have any questions?‚Äù

**Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ )** - *2017-10-25*

Afina, partially hidden by Elfriede and flanked by Kailyn and Atalantia, inspected the armor of the older man, noting the battle damage and his scruffy appearance. His confident and self-assured posture made it obvious he was high in rank, and the quick Eraian exchange between himself and Elfriede confirmed as much. Following the commander, Afina took the papers from her travel pack, flipping through them to seem busy and deserving of entry. There was no reason for them to be denied, after all. She glanced at her laguz companions. Perhaps picking her travelling company had been a mistake; they arose much more suspicion in a group such as this. Even if it did mean she had a chance at forming important political alliances as well as garnering a potential pupil.

Coming to the forefront of the counter, Afina hands the commander the papers. ‚ÄúYou said bandits, sir?‚Äù  she blurts out, intrigued at the idea. ‚ÄúOh! I-uh...Forgive me. I am Afina Tyndall, Princess to the kingdom of Laera.‚Äù She nods her head, reflectively tensing up to the perfect posture she had learned to keep in her youth. ‚ÄúAnd I am the escortee designated within those papers. I studied with a clergyman of your kingdom for many years. It is an honor to finally be traveling here.‚Äù 

Afina hesitates, looking once more at her company. It would be foolish to take a detour so early in their travels. No proper leader would derail the journey so early on. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry to hear about the troubles plaguing you with the bandits. We will most certainly send word to the church about this matter. If you don‚Äôt mind me asking, sir, but what is the state of affairs in Trisp at the moment? The nature of our excursion is detailed within the papers, but I‚Äôm curious to see how you yourself find matters.‚Äù

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2017-10-26*

*The moment guards start running towards the party, Atalantia stops her joyous howling and rapidly transforms back into her humanized form. If necessary, she would combat these guards if they were to pose any sort of a threat, or if they were to halt progress in the mission at hand* 

*Atalantia becomes slighlty perturbed by the fact that the guards are suspicious that both Kailyn and her are involved with the laguz bandits.*

"Surely these laguz people must have some sort of justification for their actions. If not, then they are clearly representing my people in a poor light. It seems to me that most of you nobles have your own misconceptions about us" *Atalantia states towards the guards and the party.*

*Facing Afina, Atalantia goes on to state,* "While I do believe it is important to get you to Eraia promptly, I can't stand by idly as my people are being discriminated against or if these bandits are acting against the morals and values that my people hold true. I would like to go and investigate so that we may bring this bandit trouble to an end. This would also give us some influence with Eraia and may give us all an opportunity to cooperate to solve a proble, which would be necessary in an alliance. Solving this conflict may also allow us all to come to a better understanding of each other."

*Atalantia then turns back to the guards* "Do you have any leads on where these bandits might be located? Or any information that might allow us to locate them easier or find a solution to this issue?"
