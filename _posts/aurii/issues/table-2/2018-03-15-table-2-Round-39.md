Due to the size of the smaller ship there is only room for two gangplanks to connect the ships. The Kouneli make full use of them though, pouring onto the ship in droves. Despite the Aster being a much larger ship, it seems the attackers have a crew at least the same size as the Aster's, if not larger. The Aster's men are hardy however, engaging with the Kouneli quickly. The fighting is sloppy, but no one can deny the sailors have a lot of power to put behind their swings. The decks are a sea of men clashing swords, axes, and the occasionally club. 

Some Kouneli come across the gang planks in their laguz form; make you wonder why they get compared to rabbits at all. They're much too large and lanky, though they still have powerful back legs that pound the wooden decks heavily. Kouneli come in somewhere around the size of a large dog, the second tallest laguz (the first being tigers) despite being the second lightest (the first being cats).

Elfriede's impressive blade work was noticed by the Kouneli mages. A fireball comes flying at Elfriede, hitting the deck to his left. Thankfully ships are coated with a fire retardant material and Elfirede doesn't find himself in an inferno. One more comes his way before they resume aiming at the masts. The sabatours aren't hard to spot, sitting on the raised back deck of the ship and lobbing shots across the gangplanks.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-03-15*

Elfriede jumped onto the plank and began to move toward the crossing Kouneli group to funnel them into a constant one on one fight, thinking himself a superior fighter. Several of them moved to engage Elfriede, but found themselves falling off the plank into the waters below; many of them sporting new leg wounds. A constant mix scraping metal and shouting resounded as Elfriede continuously knocked weapons aside and knocked the rabbit folk from the boarding plank. *If he could just hold this for a bit to buy Afina time‚Ä¶* One male came forward with reckless abandon, swinging repeatedly pushing Elfriede back a bit. 

‚ÄúSo sloppy; typical of a pirate.‚Äù Faun boasted a bit and suddenly moved forward in wake off the pirate‚Äôs swing. His pommel came forward and collided squarely in their face causing blood to run freely from the pirates nose. In a last ditch effort, the pirate came across horizontally with a hard swing of his sword. It hit nothing as Elfriede had already crouched and raised his dagger to knock the sword up in the air. Faun brought his sword up and directly through the Kouneli‚Äôs arm causing him to drop his weapon and howl in pain. Faun continued the motion with a hard shove left tugging on the wound causing the laguz to fall left of Elfriede overboard. A disgusting sound is heard as his rapier ‚Äúunsheathes itself from the laguz arm‚Äù as he falls.

Elfriede had cleared some of the plank and desperately wanted to take a breather, but a fireball came sizzling passed him and landed on the deck behind him. Elfriede grimaced and looked up at the mage who had thrown the incandescent ball of energy who was preparing to throw yet another. *Afina hasn‚Äôt been able to do anything yet.* He started to worry, but quickly cleared his mind. He didn't need the distractions. Another fireball came whizzing towards him so Elfriede, now paying attention to the mage, dove backwards to avoid it. The fireball sizzled and exploded onto the plank setting it ablaze.

Before he could count his blessings, Elfriede had rolled right into a laguz female with an axe who has been coming to flank him. They both toppled over with Elfriede landing squarely on his back, while the pirate landed in a sitting position next to him. She quickly tried to take advantage of her superior position and swung downward at Elfriede. A loud clang resounded as the boy caught the axe just centimeters from his face with a cross of his rapier and dagger. 

‚ÄúThank the good lady‚Ä¶‚Äù he caught himself saying.

**Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ )** - *2018-03-15*

‚ÄúHey!‚Äù Afina yelled indignantly, watching as a fireball sizzled past Elfriede and struck the floorboards behind him. Thankfully, the ship did not catch ablaze, instead letting the fire fizzle out to mere embers. ‚ÄúWho gave you filthy animals the right--!?‚Äù 

Though the mages were unable to hear her about the din of battle, a few nudged each other, pointing and snickering at the princess that stood upon the highest point of the Aster. Afina stomped her foot indignantly. _They aren‚Äôt taking me seriously_, she thought angrily, until another idea struck her. _So they don‚Äôt know that I‚Äôm the light mage. Idiots._

Afina opened her book, eyes glancing between the runes on the page and the band of fire mages on the other ship. A familiar white halo appeared on the floor beneath the mages, and suddenly the mages ceased laughing. Each scrambled to get out of the encirclement, horrified expressions on their faces. ‚ÄúStinkin‚Äô Eraian!‚Äù one of them hollered, and Afina‚Äôs glare intensified. _She was wearing Laeran Blue for king‚Äôs sake!_

A beam of light shot up from the ground where a circle had been moments before, and the mages gaped in horror as one of their companions was entirely swallowed up. As the light faded, two knelt down to assist their clearly-incapacitated ally, while the other two fixed their gaze on Afina. _Well, at least they‚Äôre taking me seriously now_, Afina thought, a self-satisfied expression playing across her face. 

A sudden, anger-fueled fireball then shot towards Afina, and she ducked behind a pile of crates to evade it. _How could she retaliate against two mages?_ Afina thought, eyes searching the ship for any form of assistance. None of the pirates in particular carried a shield of some sorts, which would have been the best aid in such a situation. The Laeran‚Äôs eyes lit up as she remembered how the fireballs had not set the ship ablaze. _They must be covered in some form of fire retardant_, she reasoned. 

Spotting a circular piece of wood in the deck, Afina crawled across the deck and unsheathed her sword, to wedge it between the floorboards, all the while hoping Elfriede would not glance up to see her blatant misuse of weaponry.  The floorboards creaked as she tried to pry up the piece of wood, struggling against the tightly fastened flooring. While she wasn‚Äôt particularly strong, Afina hoped that at least her weight would free the would-be shield.

With a crack, half the wood panelling came up from the ground, and Afina bit her lip. She would elect not to tell the captain about this one later, instead turning the half-circle shield towards her enemy mages. The wood was thick, and difficult to hold, but could surely provide ample defense against the fireballs. _Hm, fireballs_, Afina thought. _These mages don‚Äôt know any other fire spells?_

Afina peered her face from behind the heavy makeshift shield, trying to line up her sights for another light spell. The mages weren‚Äôt stupid enough to fall for the coalescing spell again, but perhaps a spontaneous ball of light would do the trick.
