**Bill** - *2017-12-11*

A guardsman runs out to you as you get close to the garrison. 

"And who might you... Sir Elfriede?!" the guard exclaims, recognizing the knight-lieutenant. The guard looks over Elfriede's wounds quickly and nods in Afina's direction. "Allow me mi'lady." he says, lifting Elfreide carefully and completely. He begins a quick walk back to the station.

Ransford is quickly called as Elfriede is laid down on a cot in the back of the garrison. He looks at Elfriede for mere seconds before calling down the hallway "Narder! Get you and your damn book into the squad room!". He offers Afina a chair before standing against the wall. 

He says nothing until a massive man with enough stubble to sand wood comes in, holding an equally massive tome. Afina can quickly recognize the tome as the standard healing tome in use today by all medics. Ransford nods in the direction of Elfriede and who you can assume to be Narder gets to work on casting. 

Over the spell work of his subordinate Ransford looks between Afina and Elfriede. "You left with two more, and come back injured. I assume you have a story to tell that's quite relevant to me." he says. He motions with a hand that you might as well begin. 

(ooc: Table-2 has been restructured as <@!245270932602486784>  and <@!351785752197201920>. <@!350847001937707022> has moved to table-5, still in the cabin. Where is table 5, Afina and Elfriede might ask? You're unable to read that channel until you link up with Atalantia again. @everyone is to help with keeping the events on table-5 hidden from Afina and Elfriede, to preserve the dramatic tension.)

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-11*

Elfriede sits still and stares at the floor vacantly as the healer works his magic (literally). He had felt it all before, but it's not something you get used to. The tingling itching feeling as torn muscle fiber moves to reattach itself. Bones being moved back into place. It sent several chills down his spine as his body was healed of his major injuries joints realigned. When it was all done he still was pretty sore in his shoulder and tail but felt several times better. His head wasn't spinning as bad and he felt clearer then he had in the passed few hours.

‚ÄúThank you sir. I appreciate it‚Ä¶‚Äù He said to the man quietly with numerous vocal influctions akin to embarrassment. 
Elfriede glances over to acknowledge the Guard Captain Ransford and nods ready to explain what happened.

*Elfriede explains what happened with some additions from Afina about her magical prowess*

‚ÄúI beg you to send a few men out there to round up the downed bandits for trial in the capitol. Also the two Lagu traveling companions stayed behind so the fiends didn't try to escape. Please treat them with utmost respect, as they are Afina‚Äôs guests and fought valiantly (he almost chuckled when he said that thinking of K) along side us.‚Äù Elfriede says then sighs.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm‚Ä¶ sorry to ask so much of you and your men, but could you spare to house us and our returning companions for the night, we could use the rest. I‚Äôd ask if you had bathing here but I figure that might have to wait til we return to the mainland.‚Äù 

Faun doesn‚Äôt show it, but he eagerly awaits the affirmation from the captain. He *REALLY* needs the rest.

**Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ )** - *2017-12-12*

Afina watched as Elfriede seemed to relax instantaneously. The injuries really _had_ taken a toll on his health. As he began to explain their endeavors to the hideout, Afina occasionally chimed in to add more detail. She nodded in agreement with his plea for assistance in bringing the bandits to justice. "Yes, all bandits have been incapacitated, and only need now be tried for their crimes. They should no longer be a nuisance to you, your men, or your constituents," Afina adds. 

Elfriede then sighed, imploring for lodging for the night. Afina couldn't help but shoot him a look of offended surprise from her seat across the room. Sleeping in a _cot_? She understood that they needed the rest, but a cot in a dirty military checkpoint? Without even a BATH? Surely there was an inn nearby. 

Afina turned over her cloak, noting the sanguine splotches spattered across the blue fabric. She then glanced at Elfriede's own wardrobe, seemingly soaked through in red. She shuddered, unable to imagine changing back into bloody clothes the next morning. 

She sighed. Perhaps they would at least give her one of the nicer cots. As Rainsford examined Elfriede, pondering an answer, Afina peered over at the healer's tome book. She had read these before; they never quite made as much sense as the light magic books did, and even _she_ was especially gifted. Maybe Narder would be kind enough to give her a few pointers. She frowned at his large frame and stubbly face. Yes, of course, maybe he was a _nice_ massive, magical medic. 

Still leaning over to examine Narder's healing book, she turned her attention towards the commander. She almost hoped he would deny Elfriede's request. How far could the nearest inn even _be_, she thought. An inn. With a bed. And a BATH.
