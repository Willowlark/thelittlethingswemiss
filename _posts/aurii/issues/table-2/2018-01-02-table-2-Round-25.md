**Bill** - *2018-01-02*

Ransford blocks another pair of thrusts from the cat laguz's daggers. The cat can't seem to break the Commander's guard no matter how much the kissaelain woman exhausts herself. The Commander watches her carefully, waiting for an overextension due to the constant attacking. 

Ransford crouches and rotates his shield arm, allowing him to get the shield underneath the woman's arms. He forces them up with a push of the shield, using his legs to power the shield up. The woman's arms fly straight up and she drops her daggers. She turns quickly and attempts to put space between herself and the Commander but he grabs her by the back of her shirt. With a swift thunk he knocks the woman out with the pommel of his sword. He says something quietly as he lays the woman down gently, though no one was close enough to hear.

Ransford stands tall again, effectively in the middle of the no man's land between the lines of archers. He raises his shield to deflect an arrow and surveys the battlefield from that dangerous position. He looks over to Elfriede and Afina, particularly with the bloodied princess. He gives her a slow nod of acknowledgement before turning back to the line of enemy archers.

Ransford marches forward to one of the last groups of archers. two are brave enough to take a pot shot over the massive crate that stands between the Commander and them, though the arrows bounce off of Ransford's heavy shield. The man growls as he marches up to the crate. With a mighty swing of his blade he cleaves the crate in two, causing grain to pour out of the box. The archers scramble back, but each one is beaned in the head by the Commander's shield before they can get anywhere. Statisfied the archers are out of commission, Ransford turns around to see the rest of the brawl wrap up.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-01-02*

Elfriede broke gaze from the princess and rushed the young bandit once more, eyeing Ransford again from the corner of his eye as the hardy man took down more bandits. The young Laguz smirked deviously, dropped low and went for another feint double stab low as he had done before. ‚ÄúThis must work against untrained fools a lot for him to try it twice.‚Äù, thought Elfriede with condescension. He brought his blades low again to parry when the boy suddenly pivoted, dropped his weapons, stood on his hands and kicked upward toward Faun‚Äôs chin. At the last possible moment the duelist swayed backwards, swords in the same position, and brought them both slashing outward cutting a deep gash with the razor sharp edge of his rapier in the boy‚Äôs arm.

At the same moment the boys foot collided with Elfriede‚Äôs face, not nearly as hard as he had been hit earlier in the day, but hard enough. Elfriede stumbled a few steps backwards as red ran freely from one nostril. Although annoyed, he wasn‚Äôt able to hold that visage for long as he saw the boy fall holding his bleeding arm he had just collapsed onto. Elfriede spat on the ground and sheathed his swords, thinking the battle won. He glanced once more to Ransford, and went to turn around to make sure Afina was alright. His keen ears suddenly heard frantic scuffling of feet behind him. All the hairs on his body stood up in the moment; Faun knew that he didn't have time to turn around to stop what was going to happen.

**Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ )** - *2018-01-02*

Afina continued to wipe her face, trying to remove the blood that had started coagulating on her cheek. She glanced around the room at the remains of the battle. Ransford had defeated the archers, the soldiers had disposed of most of the bandits, and Elfriede was quickly going to overwhelm his opponent. Now would be the time for reconnaissance. 

Afina knelt down towards an incapacitated bandit, light beam spell at the ready. ‚ÄúTell me where Atalantia is!‚Äù she demanded, her glowing palm in the cat laguz‚Äôs face. The dazed bandit continued to stare blankly at the ceiling. ‚ÄúTell me!‚Äù Afina yelled, the light in her palm glowing brighter. The princess frowned at the lack of a response, standing up straight to find another target. She leaned over another fallen opponent, light magic at the ready. ‚ÄúTake me to Atalantia the wolf laguz!‚Äù The man didn‚Äôt stir. In hindsight, she should have taken a hostage earlier in the fight, if the tiger bandit had not given her so much trouble. 

Across the room, Afina heard a low grunt, and turned to see Elfriede stuck in the face by a bandit‚Äôs foot. Blood began to flow from his nose, and Afina had to chuckle a little at the irony. Both of them had remained relatively injury-free, save for a nosebleed. The bandit boy collapsed, red blossoming on his shirt from an arm injury, and Elfriede turned to Afina confidently.

The laguz bandit jumped to his feet, and Elfriede began to spin around. Afina gasped. The knight lieutenant had sheathed his sword, and wouldn‚Äôt have enough time to parry. Thinking quickly, she flipped open her book and extended her hand. A beam of light shot from Afina‚Äôs palm, brighter and warmer than when she had cast it before, wind whistling through the room with the power of the blast once more. The spell passed through Elfriede and his opponent instantaneously, with drastically different effects on both men. Homely warmth swirled around Elfriede, comparable to that of a fireplace at night. His attacker, conversely, dropped his weapons, collapsing to his knees with a yell. 

The light cleared, and Afina sighed in relief. Elfriede remained completely unharmed, whilst his opponent cowered on the floor, defenseless. The knight was blinking back his ability to see again, and Afina quickly shook off her fear, replacing it with confidence. She had had the situation under control from the beginning. Of course. She walked towards Elfriede, whose face showed a mix of confusion and surprise. ‚ÄúAn awfully close fight, knight lieutenant,‚Äù she said playfully, the slightest twinge of fear still laced through her voice.
