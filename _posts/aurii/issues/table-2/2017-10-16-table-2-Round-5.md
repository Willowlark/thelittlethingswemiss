**Bill** - *2017-10-16*

Itory only raised an eyebrow when his lady Afina suggested traveling into a foreign country with only two strangers and an envoy of said country as guards. He considers it a mark of his professionalism; Many others would exclaim at their liege for such actions. 

Itory bows slightly when addressed. "I'll send a letter at once Milady. Shall I request additional guards from the Laera? It shouldn't take naught but a fortnight." he says. He waits patiently for Afina to reply, knowing she'll acknowledge him when there's a lull in conversation with the guests.

**Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ )** - *2017-10-17*

Despite the apology from  K, the corner of Afina's eye twitched with irritation, and she forced a smile. "No offense taken," she said, taking a book from her desk and flipping it open, and tracing her fingers along the pages. "In Laera, we are well aware of our own limitations as far as knowledge goes. Nonetheless, I believe that the nobility may be the most equipped to help you in your learning endeavors. After all,‚Äù she said, glancing down at the pages of her book, ‚Äúa noble taught by many scholars is smarter than any individual scholar on their own." 

With that, the lettering on the pages began to glow and shine faintly, and light pooled along the crease of the book‚Äôs pages, seemingly coming from the words themselves. Though only a small light source, it radiated brightly, and shimmered with iridescent intensity. Afina looked up haughtily.

‚ÄúAs for what I will be doing in my travels, the letter clearly indicates that no such formal training can be provided, but I believe the cultural experience can help me strengthen the proficiency I already have with my magic. Few Laerans have been to Callora, so naturally it‚Äôs a very unique experience to bring back to my people.‚Äù She nodded, slamming the book shut and snuffing out the light like a candle. 

‚ÄúAnyways, Itory, no guards will be necessary, this is a simple excursion to Eraia, and though I know it isn‚Äôt the most peaceful of times, extra guards would delay us by far too much. I think a small party can surely protect themselves, and travel faster with much better cover. A simple notification is all that my family requires, thank you.‚Äù

She turned back to her guests with a newfound confident energy. She smiled, ‚ÄúAnd if there are no other questions, I invite you to explore my library and speak with me about your travels, or to speak with Itory about your accommodations for the night. Otherwise, the next meal is in two hours.‚Äù

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-10-17*

*Elfriede nods approvingly and smirks*

"Thank you for your kindness, hospitality and access to your wealth of books, although I'm surprised to find you so trusting of strangers Lady Tyndall." 

*He places one hand on his hilt non-threateningly, glances around the room with narrowed eyes and gives a sort of disapproving frown at the other guests.*

*He then steps away towards the shelves of Non-Fiction books and starts to finger through them and stops on a book about modern military tactics and retrieves it. Faun then glaces around to make sure noones looking and retrieves a book from the Fiction section as well titled: Forbidden love*
*Elfriede takes a seat on one of the comfortable reading chairs that lavish the room and starts to read and thinks to himself, (I'll finish these before bed.)*

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2017-10-17*

*Atalantia's ears perk up in excitement after observing the indication that she may be able to make progress on completing her challenge.*

*Speaking towards Afina, Atalantia  states,* "I can assure you that I am more than capable of handling whatever danger may come our way during the travel to Eraia. While I may not look it, I am in fact the strongest member of my pack, and I am positive that I am stronger than any guard your people may send. Therefore it is in my honor and best interest to ensure our safety,  especially if it can lead me closer to forming a symbol of alliance with you."

*Atalantia bows her head towards Afina, and then proceeds to browse the library's selection of books. Atalantia searches for any book revolving the Wynne people and their tradition of competing for the title of ruler of Wynne.*

**Kailyn (John B)** - *2017-10-19*

*Kailyn mouth widened from  Afina's magic. Before she knew it, the glow faded and the other two visitors wandered while she still stood there. You could see a smirk on her mouth; she felt that she might've offended the princess with her words, the princess' actions and speech made that ring true, but she saw something that gave her a direction to go on.*

*The knowledge and power shown to Kailyn made following Afina her mission, but what made her enjoy it more was the princess' slight hostility, the need to be right, a slight spunk that made her knew she'd enjoy her travels. She moves up to Afina.*

"I can't wait to join you on your journey," Kailyn says with a small smirk and toss of her hair. The formalities were over as Kailyn walked over to the bookshelf to fetch a selection of books on magic and history. She'll be reading until supper and finish up before heading to bed.
