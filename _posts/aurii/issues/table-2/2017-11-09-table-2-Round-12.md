**Bill** - *2017-11-09*

(ooc: Atalania has seen the cliff beyond the shack.)

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-11-09*

*Elfriede nods and moves back into the flush area of the forest*

**Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ )** - *2017-11-09*

Afina hesitates, knowing that a pre-emptied strike succeeds more often than one made after the fact. However... her reputation had already taken more than enough blows for one day. She looks at Elfriede, who had already retreated into the forest, and Atalantia, who seemed to acquiesce the plan now that casualties had been minimized. "Agreed." Afina nodded, climbing back into the cover of the forest. "And if... the situation derails. Do we have an attack word?"
