**Bill** - *2017-11-16*

As soon as Kailyn knocks on the door an almost comical amount of noise comes from the other side. Among them include the sound of a wooden chair being pushed back, bottles rocking back and forth on a table, and coins dropping to the floor. Feet patter around in the room and there's a clipped call of "Uh, just a moment!".

As the noise settles down Kailyn's ears can tell footsteps are moving towards her and the door. The door opens to a young laguz man, with black furred ears and a white tail. His blonde hair rounds out his tabby hair color, mussed slightly. Behind him is a laguz woman around the same age, with white fur and short black hair. She's leaning against a dresser in a rather awkward fashion. Kailyn can see more furniture in the room, a table pushed against the opposite wall with cards and small pile of coins on it as well as a cot by the dresser. Nothing adorns the wall opposite the door. 

The man stands in the doorway, opening the door completely. "Ah, ha..." he sighs a bit. "Sorry for the wait. What... wait can we do for you?" The woman waves with her free hand.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-11-19*

*Elfriede shifts uncomfortablly in the brush*

*He can almost feel the bugs from the thick brush starting to crawl on him*

*A shiver goes down his spine*

(Ughhh it's going to take forever getting the bugs out of his tail again if they re-nest. He's going to have to scrub for hours...- - - Wait! Task at hand!)

*Elfriede glances over at the doorway where the two voices are coming from* 

*Unable to decern whether or not they were friend or foe he'd have to leave it up to K. The boy glances over to Afina in the grass next to him to see what she thinks.*

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2017-11-23*

Atalantia stands next to K at the doorway as planned. Immediately Atalantia notices the two seemingly innocent laguz in the house *"As I thought, these Laguz people may be harmless" Atalantia thinks to herself, but she wasn't ready to let her guard down.*

Atalantia waited a few seconds before she butted in, but her curiosity was killing her as she waited for K to say something. Atalantia had to think of a reasonable explanation as to why they had stopped at these Laguz people's home. 
"Hello there, I am terribly sorry to bug you, but we were passing through this area and we were wondering if you might be able to offer us a place to rest during our travels. We have been traveling for days will little to no rest, and this home seems like the proper location to regain our strength. I'd be willing to repay the both of you if necessary as well" Atalantia eagerly awaits for the response of the two Laguz.

**Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ )** - *2017-11-23*

Afina frowns as she sees the laguz man standing in the doorway. Slowly but surely, the commander‚Äôs description of the bandit hideout was coming true. Secluded, small, populated in majority by laguz. The only real question now was what to be done of the bandits. They didn‚Äôt seem hostile yet but‚Ä¶ with time‚Ä¶

She glanced down at her book once more, anxiously thumbing the pages of the defense light magic tomes. The first sign of trouble and she would begin casting immediately. In the meantime, she had to put faith in the charisma of her company, and hope the situation would be turned to their advantage. She bit her lip, watching the laguz man address the two women. This situation had too much potential to go from bad to worse. Glancing at Elfriede, she noticed his questioning gaze, as if prompting for her thoughts.

‚ÄúI think our comrades have the situation under control at the moment. I‚Äôm nervous, undoubtedly. But this is a‚Ä¶ sensitive topic. Laguz are best to deal with a racially-charged laguz matter, yes? So we should be alright,‚Äù She forced a smile. ‚ÄúAfter all, as nobles especially, we have years of basic battle training to help us, just as K and Atalantia have‚Ä¶‚Äù Afina caught herself, wondering the best way to phrase her (clearly, fact-checked) assumptions. ‚ÄúThey have their years of street smarts garnered from their travels.‚Äù She nodded confidently, turning her attention to the conversation arising from the doorway.

**Kailyn (John B)** - *2017-11-27*

Kailyn knows what she heard. The fall of coin and their awkward stance. They are hiding something, that can be certain.

However their presence is rather friendly at this time for bandits. More of this meets the eye. She awaits their response to Atalantia's request.
