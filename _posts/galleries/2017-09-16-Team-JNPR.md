Thanks to *very* diligent efforts of Wezrez we were able to assemble the entire Team JNPR for a photoshoot! If you've ever been to a RWBY photoshoot you'll know the entire Team JNPR never makes it. Must be running late, as usual. =)

It was also a great shoot because I got to meet up with some of my favorite people on the con circuit. If I had not meet the people you see here, there are two dozen people I never would have met and I wouldn't be doing photography at the level I am right now. It's only fitting that, since I met them at the first con of the season, I saw them again at the end of it. Special props to the below people, you guys are the best. =)
