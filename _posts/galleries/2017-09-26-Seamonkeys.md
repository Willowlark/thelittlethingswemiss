I've taken photos of Emerling cosplay quite a few times now. Just recently as Jaune in our [Team JNPR]({% link _posts/galleries/2017-09-16-Team-JNPR.md &}) photoshoot. During said shoot, I had told him multiple times to be "less Neptune". This photo shoot is exactly why. He's got Neptune's cool dialed in so well I *really* can't picture him as anything else. (No pun intended.) 

For a completely unplanned shoot these photos came out really well. I had just met dudedoescos through our mutual friends we just started shooting while chatting. Little did we know it would turn out as great as it did!
