## Outfit 1

Sherwood wears a [sweatshirt](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/cb/98/3d/cb983d983a9bc4544a3c9c00df4ad3b6.jpg) over a black athletic shirt. The sweatshirt is orange base, with the shoulders a grey white and a black stripe separating the two. The sweatshirt has a high collar with a drawstring that allows it to wrap around his neck for warmth. It has no hood. The sleeves are tight to his arms. This keeps them out of the way of any arrow's path. He wears green [fatigues](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/cc/ea/5a/ccea5a64c1e78126f252bdc494d55227.jpg) with a variety of pockets and and loops for tools and gear. The fatigues are a heavy weight material, designed to not be damaged doing athletic activity in the woods. His [boots](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/38/6a/5e/386a5e2294e5c45fc6c21175342984ee.jpg) are two two, top section classic tan leather color and the bottom a dark brown. The top is a sturdy felt, soft to the touch and keeps warmth in when his boots are wet. The bottom is steel toed, a harder shell to hold up against rough terrain.

## Outfit 2

Sherwood has an alternate [outfit](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/1b/54/4b/1b544b8246c67011e290dda191f5b674.jpg) consisting of a leather jacket, white button up, and blue jeans. He can use his full combat apparel minus the shoulder quiver with this outfit as well, but he has less mobility in his arms than his usual outfit. 

## Combat Apparel

Sherwood's combat apparel starts with a [hip bag](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/35/8d/e1/358de148f69da56d1f4a0c6c815f489c.jpg) that ties tightly to his right thigh. He prefers this to a backpack as it keeps his shoulders free for bow draws. The belt the bag mounts to has a mount point on the back for his quiver. The mount rotates and allows the quiver to detach. Sherwood carries a [knife](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/5e/b8/12/5eb8121c3da50229839eec8a166982fb.jpg) more for bushcraft purposes, he has a sheath mounted both in his bag and for his left hip. At times he uses an over the [shoulder mount](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/3e/c2/1d/3ec21d1cde649bac6344aba244180bb1.jpg) for his quiver. He wears a pair of tan [gloves](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/79/0e/d3/790ed300a40af89d9a93e561b68b6f6a.jpg) that are fitted to his hands. They're braced for the tension between his bow and the mount point of Tristram. 

# History

Sherwood was born to a family of hunters in a small village on the western border of Vale. He grew up there, one of very few children in his age bracket. Sherwood never bonded with the others in his age group, preferring to spend as much time as possible learning his father's trade. Sherwood began hunting as soon as he was old enough to, starting on squirrels and rabbits outside the village walls before moving on to proper game. He was taught carefully how to avoid attracting Grimm while stalking game. He was also taught that Grimm are the apex predator out in the woods; they will overpower the unsuspecting hunter and kill them outright. 

In his early teens, Sherwood went deeper in the woods than usual and was caught by a surprise rain storm. He slid down an embankment by accident, ending up outside a den of Beowolves. Lamenting his mistakes he braced to end up in pieces, but an iron arrow head flew over his shoulder, killing the lead beowolf in a single shot. An older man approached from the deep woods, wielding a massive bow that had no bowstring. The man fired his whole quiver as Sherwood got away from the cave mouth, killing one if not two Grimm with every arrow. With the last arrow the man leans into the nearest tree, clearly exhausted. A single beowolf remains, and stalks towards the man. Sherwood takes aim, waiting patiently for his shot and taking it just in time. The arrow doesn't kill the beowolf, but slows it enough for the man to knife the beowolf. 

Sherwood takes the exhausted man back to the village, after reclaiming his unique arrows from the once Grimm corpses. The man's name is Oswald Noir, of the Noir family. He is a legendary huntsman, though long past his prime. Oswald takes a liking to Sherwood, offering to teach the boy combat archery techniques. Sherwood accepts, and is a quick study. Time passes and Sherwood gains a drive from Oswald, a drive to hunt the apex predator of humans. Unfortunately Oswald's health starts to get worse. Sherwood and his family take care of the man in his last days, as he refuses to return to his family to squabbles with his son, who relinquished the role of huntsman to run a museum of huntsman paraphernalia for profit. Oswald's last gift to Sherwood is his custom weapon, Tristram. Oswald asked Sherwood to carry on in his footsteps, to be the hunter of Grimm his own son failed to be. Sherwood accepts, enticed by the same drive the man himself had. 

Sherwood trains further with Tristram, focusing entirely on his archery. It gets him through Beacon practicals, and between his own work and a recommendation written by Oswald he got past the written exams. He leaves for Beacon to learn about the Grimm, because to know thine enemy is necessary for their destruction. 

# Personality

Sherwood is a simplistic person. He sees the beauty in simplicity, relishing in silence and his tasks. He enjoys hunting because it is both solitary and something that requires focus. Sherwood is very observant and in touch with his surroundings due to his skills as a hunter. He is a good student when he has an interest in the subject; he otherwise finds book learning dull. He is primarily a learn by doing type. Sherwood has personal drive to become powerful enough to hunt Grimm, who he considers predators of man. Sherwood can be very independent in his planning process, a hold over from being a hunter. Sherwood is occasionally naive, as he tends to be narrow minded in his learning. 

# Combat Ability

Sherwood is a glass cannon type of fighter. He has two weapons, his electromagnetic bow *Tristram* and a normal combat knife. He rarely uses the knife in a proper fight, he carries it mostly for bushcraft and utility purposes. He's practiced both knife fighting and throwing in the past, fighting isn't something he enjoys but throwing is interesting enough to him. 

Tristram is a powerful weapon, launching conductive metal arrows at high speeds. Due to the arrow's weight and tension at which they are launched, they create a shock wave effect in the area as they fly. This effect is stronger the further the arrow flies. Tristram can be overpulled, which takes Sherwood about 10 seconds to stabilize doing. This increases the power three fold. The arrows themselves hit like harpoons, high penetration metal spears that hit with incredible force. When the arrow flies long enough to have a shock wave effect, the wave hits like a slash around the impact point. This translates to a knock back on the target. 

Sherwood is weak in the melee range bracket. He's forced to rely on his knife skills when opponents are too close for him to draw his bow. He usually tries to retreat out of this range if he ends up in it. In the short range, Tristram becomes his weapon of choice past 50 yards. The shock wave effect doesn't occur till over 200 yards, and Tristram's max range without an over pull is approximately 260 yards. With the over pull, Sherwood can gain at least another 100 yards over that, though he's yet to test that range properly. 

## Aura & Semblance

Sherwood has a fair amount of skill with his aura. He only uses it for shielding and regeneration. In theory he could use aura strengthening techniques to increase his draw speed on a full pull of Tristram, but he's yet to learn that technique with aura. 
Sherwood has a semblance for electricity. He hasn't used it extensively, and only really has one technique. He conducts electricity from his right hand into one of his iron arrows, creating a beam between him and where the arrow landed. He can then have that current bounce from arrow to arrow, if multiple lie around the battlefield. He can control the arc between himself and a point rather well, able to twist and turn it to attack. 

## Tristram 

### Bow Form

Tristram is an electromagnetic longbow, measuring 62" when assembled. The limbs are of a take down variety, they snap into the center *riser* of the bow, held in place by the tension of the bow string. Tristram is unique in it's construction that it has no bow string. Where the string would normally attach to the limb is a short, 1 inch metal cable ending in a magnetic piece. The two cable endings attract to each other, creating the same tension formed by a bow string via magnetism. Sherwood has a short rod that serves as the nock of the 'bow string', it floats in the magnetic tension right in line with the arrow rest. Arrows are nocked against this piece. 

Due to the unique nature of Tristram, it has a tremendous amount of power to release when used. Wooden arrows are shredded on even a partial pull of the string. The magnetic bow string gives Tristram an incredibly high draw weight, over 100 pounds. Sherwood's bow hand glove actually has magnets in it which pair to magnets in the grip in order to keep it from launching out his hand when it release an arrow. When over pulling, it still skips out of his hand for a half second. 

Tristram cannot fire wooden arrows. It has custom solid conductive metal arrows. This have a twisted point, looking like a four part spiral. The arrows have no feathers. The arrows weight reduce the incredible range that could come with Tristram's power, but as a trade off for gaining no additional range over a regular bow the arrows hit like a truck. 

### Collapsed Form

When Tristram has it's limb detached, the limbs can be held in place using the same magnets that hold it primed. They line up with the riser, removing the height gained by the two limbs from the overall height. Sherwood's quiver has a mount point for the riser when in this form, allowing him to stow the bow over the quiver.
