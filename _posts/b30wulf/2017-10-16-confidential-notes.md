GM Notes for the Play by Post.

# National Persons

## Wynne

### Chieftain Rivor Eckiir

Rivor is in his late 40's early 50's. His hair is salt and pepper and parts in the center. He's got a serious face and the lines on it are weathered. While a pleasant and kind man if you know him, Rivor is guarded with most and professional with the rest. He wears fur cloaks and half length jackets depending on the activity, but wears fur lined heavy leather armor rather than metal. He fights with a greatsword, often swung with one hand. He's well versed in brawling as well. 

Rivor is a staunch supporter of Wynne being left alone to it's corner. Only a few Callorian kingdoms can freely speak to the man, and no other country is welcomed in his chamber. Similiarly he isn't interested in the dealings of the main land, outwardly. He follows the war very closely behind closed doors. He believes in knowing the lay of the land, and in this case knowledge of the other kingdom's movements is more valuable to him than gold. Rivor is having difficulties keeping his interest in the mainland 'nonchalant' as he's expected to feel towards it. 

### Naissankari Pack Leader Lorawryn Loough

Lorawryn is a wiry girl with stick straight light black hair. While she's a fair build she's well packed with muscle. She dresses heavy, with something like a miko's outfit of furs and leathers. She has piercing blue eyes. She wears a bear claw glove while not transformed on her right arm. She fights with that claw in human form, as well as a spear. 

Lorawryn is not very happy Atalantia left. Lorawryn admired the older girl, striving to be like her. When Atalantia left because she was bored in their ancestral home, Lorawryn took that as a person offense. Striving for power herself, she trained hard to become the pack leader. She's not content to let Atalania's perceived betrayal go unpunished though...

### Naissankari Ex Alpha _ ? 

*Atalantia's ousted brother.*

## Callora

lol.

## Eraia

### Grand Cardinal Etrani Enthmor

Etrani is a hawk eyed older man. In his mid 60's he's not the athlete he once used to be despite being in shape for his age. Always in his clergy robes, ornate cloth wih tassels and stitching worthy of his title. His hair is white, with a receeded hair line and his shoulder length hair always tied in a bun under his hat. Etrani is a powerful light mage, though he doesn't carry a spellbook often.

Etrani was a boy around when Eraia was still going to 'crusade for Lylalel's light'. Etrani has been waiting his entire life for the crusade to begin again, though he doesn't publicly express that. The war with Eraia is a stepping stone to that effect in his eyes. Etrani encourages the war and pours resources into anything related to the fighting. He's not an evil person; but he is a true believer that Eraia's purpose is to enlighten the world of Lylalel. 

### Knights Commander Dynskl Kelrr

Dynskl is a muscular man in his mid 30ths. His black-brown hair is wavy and swept to the side, and he has visible sideburns. He has green eyes and a subtle jawline, the only thing subtle about his frame. He is always wearing his black breastplate, and otherwise wears white attire befitting his rank. It more common to see him decked out in his full armor, though he doesn't wear the true heavy armor of Eraia, he prefers having more mobility. He fights with a sword and shield, the sword well made by plain while the shield bears his crest.

He believes entirely in Lylalel but doesn't feel Eraia is ready for war. His thoughts fall on deaf ears in the church. He leads his men to the best of his ability, but some foolhardy movements by other commanders have left him making tough choices recently. He isn't happy about foolish loss of life and is trying to convince the clergy to act in the interest of Eraian lives rather than Eraia's crusade.

### Sage Progidy Enera Kelit

Enera is a 13 year old girl whose skill with light magic is unheard of. Her straw blonde hair and freckles face give her the look of a farmer's daughter, which she is. When not in clergy garb she wears sun dresses and white is still a theme color for her. Enera is young, still amazed with the world.

Enera was actually from a Callorian border town and was spirited away by Eraia when they heard of her talents. Enera has to grasp the whole picture that she's being held prisoner in *Trisp*. She is the best there is at light magic, it seems to flow through her. The church is trying to decide if she's a prophet of Lylalel... or a false goddess. 

### Cardinal of Trisp Morras Raive



## Rabbellion Leader Asl Iausti

Asl is a middle aged rabbit laguz with a large build. She has brown hair and eyes and is always dressed in the typical peasants clothing, her ears being the only thing that has her stand out in a crowd. She's not a fighter, but she's as skilled as Dryn at moving people and leading forces. Extremely driven and sensative to laguz rights. 

Asl was a business woman before Eraian's took her store to build a new church. This sent her in a downward spiral that led to her first interaction with the Rabbellion. She joined up with them having no where else to go and a new found hatred for Eraia. She found herself sucked into the Rabbellion leadership, her business acumen and personality gaining her respect of the entire organization. The Rabbellion has been moving quickly since she took charge, so quickly they may soon be a threat to Eraia...

### Specialist Yuria Faun

## Thenovene

### Expansionist Party; Taiver Uori of Tanner's Guild

A man in his mid 40's whose primary color is brown. He has rich brown hair, brown eyes, and dresses in brown and black leathers. He's rather plain looking, but when he opens his mouth he's anything but. A convincing and persuasive man who comes off for the people, He has many followers on the council. 

Tavier is leading a sizable fraction of the Guilds in a secret movement against the current chair. He and his trusted allies have hatched a plan to force the Isolationist guild leaders out of their seats and place his allies in their place. If he's successful, he can swing the against isolationism. 

### Isolationist Party; Ria Schytas of Glassblower's Guild

Ria is young but wise. Around her late 20's, she has brown hair always tied up in a short ponytail on her head. Her face often has soot stains as do her clothes, and she wears pants under her skirt which also tend to be stained. She's a natural beauty, with green eyes and freckles. Ria is very pragmatic and grew up with the Guild Charter in her life, she is strongly aligned with the founders of Theanovene and is firmly against anything not in the charter. 

Ria is currently locked in battles with the council. She, as the most outspoken person on the isolationist ticket, ended up as their defacto voice. While she loves standing for what Theanovene was built on she does not like the endless toils against other guild leaders trying to circumvent it. She's found herself spending more time in the council hall than her own guild. 

### Senior Council Chair Irvess Reds of Baker's Guild

Irvess is a wiry, tossled hair kind of guy. In his late 20's early 30's. He's surprisingly toned for someone who does little in the way of exercise, though his tunic and other garb usually hide his build well. He was made guild leader not through ambition, but by the other leader's insistion. Irvess is a good leader, organized and responsible with a good head for people. It's what got him to the Senior chair role. 

Irvess is a bookkeeper caught in a war between politicians. He doesn't express his own opinions well (which fall in line with the Charter) and even if he disagrees with another party he respects the fairness of voting and equal opportunity to speak. It's this that's setting him to be blustered around by Taiver. Being the peacekeeper in the council chambers is starting to stress him.

### Former Sage Ackyns Yvere

Ackyns is in his late 20's with tannish black hair and blue eyes. Ackyns doesn't stand out in a crowd intentionally, considering the bad press he's received before. Ironically hoods and cloaks fits his reputation to a tee. Ackyns is an earnest, hard working fellow with a real drive to do good in the world.

Ackyns was a up and coming Sage in Theanovene when he found elder magic. As a simple man, he read up and made the best use of it he could. His elder magic blood transfusion spell was groundbreaking work and he brought it to the spellcrafting guild, wondering why no one else brought in elder magic. He was soon black balled as a sage and had tons of bad press surrounding him as the 'dark sage'. Ackyns wasn't dissuaded in his studies. He firmly wants to prove elder magic is worth of the name elder rather than dark and is still working to prove it in Theanovene. He's started to speak to other dark magic casters as well.

### Grand Sage Osbury Nonim

Late 60's sage with grey eyes and brown hair. Tends to wear quirky outfits. 

Wizened and trusted by Theanovene as a whole, he's your go to for magical mishaps. His most recent apprentice has 'defected' to Dreca and it's killing the old man. 

## Dreca

### Lord General Dryn Wulfa

Dryn is a dark haired man with piercing brown eyes. His features are exotic and all round beautiful. He's built to an average size and doesn't show the amount of muscle mass he has. He dresses in light armor and militaristic clothes with accents that highlight his title. Dryn has a smooth voice and is charismatic to a fault. A man driven in everything he does, his rise to power had no luck involved; it was all his intelligence and wit. He wields either a lance or sword, depending on the situation and if he's riding a Wyvern or not. 

Dryn is running a war campaign and a political upheaval. He's changed the nation of Dreca in his vision, making it a militaristic country with with a powerful need to expand and prove itself on the international stage. He's coordinated the assault on the mainland, conquering the Kissaelain territories and attacking Eraia without hesitation. Dryn is calculating and smart in his movements on the war front, making him a dangerous opponent. 

### Anima Sage Anis Lyroda

Anis is a mid 20's male with blonde hair and blue eyes. He dresses in sage's garb with a flowing cape and carries a messenger bag at all times with tomes. Anis is intelligent and practical, he makes decisions that are best for him. He cares less for morals than the study of magic.

A gifted user of anima magics, he's recently joined up with Dryn in a semi allied state. Anis shares research with Dryn in return for protection, a workshop, and the peace of mind knowing Anis is on the winning team. The contributions have been good thus far and are helping the Drecian war effort. If Anis is left alone soon Dreca will advance beyond Theanovene's best sages, much to Anis's tutor's chagin. **Osbury Nonim** is trying to take responsibility for his apprentice any way he can.

## Unaligned

### Duren Pirates Captain Reaz Nupin

Reaz is a man in his 50's, shaggy beard and slightly long hair with blue eyes. He wears no hat and has bandanas tied around the upper armors of his leather jacket. His jacket is his sole piece of armor, and he'll quickly shed it when fighting with his cutlass.

Reaz is out for himself and no one else, be it crew or civilians, country or kingdom. The only reason he has a crew is his success rate in naval combat and raid planning. He's never been defeated from the helm of his ship and you can count on one hand the number of raids that failed under his lead. He's recently been a happy man, taking advantage of the Eraian focus on the war front to raid coastal towns in the country. 

# Things in Motion

## Rivor's need for intelligence

Rivor is very interested in the happenings on the mainland. He's concerned whose winning, whose got the moral high ground, and whose worth putting Wynne's weight behind in a time of need. He is the only one thinking ahead to this 'time of need', the rest of the Wynne elders want nothing to do with the mainland no way no how. Rivor can't change his stance, less he lose allies among his own people, but he can't in good conscious ignore the mainland. He'd love for some foreigners to show up he can convince to gather information for him. 

## Expansionist ploy

Taiver is trying to convince Eraia, particularly Etrani to sign off on his ploy to change Theanovene's political stance. His plan involves coordinating a series of suspicious disappearances of his political opponents over the course of 24 hours. After capturing each, he'll have hired mercenaries take them all into Drecian territory and make them disappear. This allows Taiver to blame Dreca if the bodies are found or get away with it otherwise. He's aware something will stink at the end of this though. He believes he can swing the people of Theanovene his way, but he wants assurance Eraia will continue their dealings with him. He promises better rates and more caravans than Callora gets if Eraia stands with him. 

## Release Enera

Upon light investigation it will become obvious how Enera ended up in Trisp is subject. Upon digging into it Morras Raive orchestrated her capture and is keeping her at Trisp. In his eyes, Enera may be a false god and she must be eliminated if she is. 

## Dryn's War

### Eraian War Tent

Eraian clergy are currently pushing the army too hard. The refuse to listen to the Knight Commander and have thrown all their forces in on the crusade. They're protecting the trade route to Theanovene and fighting on the plains primarily. Pirates and Bandits have cropped up all over Eraian territory due to the missing military presence. 

### Drecian War Tent

Dryn's been attempting to get Eraia to double down on protecting their Theanovene trade route. Dryn has no interest in cutting off the trade route with Theanovene, as **it's likely to force Callora and Eraia together.** He wants Eraia to put more and more of their forces protecting that before he does a large advance, hopefully gaining ground with a full rout. 

## Stopping Anis from supporting Dryn, request by Osbury.

Osbury is looked down on in Theanovene due to Anis's siding with Dryn. Osbury is unwilling to condemn his apprentice and is looking for someone to convince the boy to return home. Osbury cares deeply for Anis and knows that Anis is only misguided.
