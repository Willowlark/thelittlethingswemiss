excerpt: My FAQs for con photography. 
---

**My intent:** I started taking photos at cons to make new friends doing something I love to do. I'm not exactly outgoing, but I do want to get to know you. I'm not very formal *just look at how much sarcasm is in this FAQ*, so just talk to me and we'll figure it out. 

* **Will you shoot for me?** Yup. Like in the intent, just talk to me. Doesn't even have to be at a con, heck, if I'm free what better way to spend a day than taking some photos?

* **How long will you shoot for?** Is technically the wrong question. The question is how long do we need to do all the cool poses and photo ideas we can come up with. So long as I have no other engagement, I'm not going to limit anyone to X minutes.

* **How many photos?** - Anything I take that looks good I'm going to share with you. *For an idea, at AnimeNext'17 I had two shoots go over an hour come out with 60 some odd photos. Shoots are a half hour ranged between 20 and 30 photos. For shorter than 30, it was more like 10.* While there's certainly no guarantee, I'm almost positive you'll end up with more than 5-7. 

* **When will you share the photos?:** Unfortunately photography is my hobby, not my full time job. I can't make any promises, especially if there's a lot of quality photos. I can say I start with planned shoots before gathering or hall photos. 

* **Can you edit out X or Y?** No, for two reasons. The first is editing, photoshopping, tweaking, adding flames, and so on isn't my style as a photographer nor is it something I enjoy doing. Two, while I have used photoshop on and off through the years, I've never really practiced editing photos in the above ways. Even if I did try, it'd be obvious and no one would be happy. 
> Addendum: I don't pull the photos off the sd card and just uploaded them either. Quickest way of describing what I do is Exposure Corrections; I fix issues that come from how I took the photo. My ideal would be to take the shot 'perfectly' with the camera but while I work towards that goal I close the gap in Lightroom. 

* **What can I do with the photos?** Share/Tweet/Insta...gram away! It always makes my day when someone shares one of my photos. All I ask you do credit me somewhere, tag my facebook page or instagram or where ever you're posting. Now if you want to dive into print media or selling things, shoot me a message. I'd like to know that's happening, but I also post images at screen resolution and watermarked and often the real images are considerably larger than that. I'll be able to get you the best possible file for print media.

* **Can my friend be in the pictures too?** Yeah. The more new friends the merrier, or so they say. However, when I plan a shoot there's a different between "shots of me with my friend" and "shots of me and my friend." The latter implies both of you are the 'star' of the photoshoot, the prior implies only you are. Let me know which it is before hand so I know what to plan for. 

* **Can you shoot a group?** When I say group here, I'm talking you have someone cosplaying every character in the series and everyone's the 'star'. Yes, I'll shoot a big group, just the same rule as above, don't surprise me with 50 cosplayers when I was supposed to be meeting one. 

* **Can you shoot X?** Whatever you'd like me to shoot, I'll certainly give it a try, assuming I have the means to. Jumping photos, beach events, cosplayers vs grizzly bears, fashion shows, whatever. 

* **Might I suggest X?** - Yes, yes you can. I don't know everything, so definitely share whatever you're thinking.

## And as for the question you probably want answered most:

**Rates**: I don't charge anything. This isn't a business to me, this is something I do for fun and to meet people. I like it when people get photos they're happy about. I'm not looking for clients. I'm looking to make new friends. 

**That said**, I will accept tips. Tips are accepted in the following formats:
    
* **A)** Pick up the first round at the hotel bar so we can sit and chat;  

* **B)** Some kind of pretzel related food-bribe, such as soft pretzels or pretzel M&Ms; 

* **C)** If you aren't of age, offering to a buy a round before snapping one's finger's and saying in a loud, over exaggerated voice: 
  > "Golly jee wilkers Mr Photographer man, I did have every gosh good intention to buy you that there drink, I swear! I'll be sure to remember when I'm as old you mister, so let me off the hook just this once?"

*Only points "B" and "C" above are sarcastic. **Have your own screwball idea for a tip?** Below is a list of the eccentric and unique tips I've received in the past. I'll not only be happy to receive your unique tip idea but I'll be sure to immortalize it by adding it to the list. Also find a running total of the number of golly jee wilkers I've received as tips.*

### (Golly Jee Wilkers Count: 4)

* Tipped with dinner by Beacon's Headmaster and Assistant Headmaster for photographing one of their students, four year tournament champion Pyrrha Nikos, a wonderful young maiden. (For some reason she won't be able to attend yearbook picture day later in the year, go figure.)
