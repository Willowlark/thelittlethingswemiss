## Locations

- 

## Poses

* "The move" patient Steve Martin. Jaune awkwardly trying to do so Pyrrha. Ren and Nora in the background rooting/observing.

* Scooby doo, heads peeking out of in a column around a door. 

* Girls Gossiping:

  * The girls gossiping with the boys behind them (staggered, bust up for the girls) looking clueless.

  * From the guys, (bust up and from behind), the girls look over their shoulder at them. Stare judgingly.

  * The same, but with giggling girls.

  * The girls talking, Nora's probably embaressing Pyrrha, and Jaune's trying to listen in just out of frame.

* Playing cards. Nora enthusastic, Ren doesn't want to play, Pyrrha is placating and Jaune is frustrated.

* Nora and Pyrrha comparing hair styles, nails, just general feminine notes.

* Pyrrha lifting Magnhild.
