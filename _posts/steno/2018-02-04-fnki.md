1. Feminine sit, one leg to each side. Be sure to show roller skates in frame. Lean inwards a little bit.

6. *Skating shots, but very unlikely we can do actual skating indoors.*

1. Leaning up against something or that kind of pose without a wall. Knee out a bit. Head looking down, hand holding hat brim.

2. Playing the horn. *Tell him to Jazz it up and just snap as he 'plays'*
3. Power slide horn attack. 
4. Wide shrug, open palms out. Cocked head, [smirk](https://i.imgur.com/D5U2nsV.jpg).
5. Swipe the brim of your hat, power stance, trumpet raised but not ready.
6. Potential slow mo hat flip?
7. Rotate a bit from this shot so the trumpet doesn't stick out as much. ![](https://i.imgur.com/4U1dVZw.png)

1. Background is Flynt, power stance doing a trumpet blow attack. Foreground is Neon skating in the path of the attack. She's ducked enough to be able to see Flynt. Don't shoot dead on, somewhere between front and 3/4ths.
