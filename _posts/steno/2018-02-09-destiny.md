1. Pyrrha with her forearm across Cinder's neck in a choke. Pyrrha is desperate, Cinder is confident. Effectively bust height.
    - Try and expand it out. Cinder leans into Pyrrha a bit, Pyrrha has her arms wide. Pyrrha's other arm should be her shield arm, flared out. 
    - 3/4ths view, on Pyrrha's open shoulder side.
    - Add Milo in Pyrrha's off hand, under the forearm choking her. Cinder grabs at it, pulling it away from her body, struggling.
2. Similar to the above, with Pyrrha being choked from behind by Cinder. Cinder should lean into it a bit, enjoying herself. 
    - Pyrrha is defiantly looking at Cinder
    - Pyrrha is wincing, pained.
3. Pyrrha on her knees looking down and defeated. Cinder standing in front of her. Cinder is confident, hip pop and arm on hip. Shot from Pyrrha's eye level, getting Cinder's hips and legs in frame. 
    - Pyrrha looking up definiately.
4. Cinder elbow thrusting Pyrrha out of a choke hold. Start in the choke hold then step into Pyrrha and add the raised elbow.
