# Rules

## Narrative Truth

> Within the imagined world of your shared narrative, everything the players describe happens exactly how they describe it , when they describe it. This is called "the Principle of Narrative Truth" and it’s the nitrous that makes Wushu fast and furious. Actions should always be phrased in the present tense: "I kick him," "I fly over that," "They crash through the wall like wrecking balls." No need to wait for the dice to tell you what happens.

This is important to keep in mind. (Keep in mind Wushu is written with the idea of kung fu movies. Some of the phrasing in the book is flavored with that.) Some other things of note about writing for the game:

* Don't be a [Mary Sue](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue). It's okay to lose. It's okay to do poorly. Flaws make better characters than skills do. 
* Don't avoid the problem, solve the problem. If you need to land a crashing plane, flying away with a jet pack does not solve the problem. Getting into the cockpit and trying to land it despite the busted controls is solving the problem.

## Conflict Resolution (How you do things)

When you need to do something in Wushu, and there's an *obstacle* in your way, you have to score a number of hits against the obstacle. The Gamemaster will assign that number, which is nicknamed the *threat level*. You score hits by doing the following. 

1. Narrate what you're doing. The more details, the better!
2. For every detail in your action, the gamemaster will reward you with a die. You'll be given a number of dice to roll. (The maximum for this pool of dice is consistent for everyone in the conflict.)
3. The gamemaster will tell you what your *relevant aspect* is. This is the aspect on your character sheet that most relates to what you're doing. Your *target number* is the number related to that aspect.
4. Decide how many dice that, if rolled as hits, will reduce the *threat level* (attack dice) and how many dice will protect you from damage (defense dice). 
5. Roll all the attack dice and then all the defense dice. For every die that comes out **less than or equal to** your *target number*, you succeed. Every success on an attack die reduces the threat level by one, every success on a defense die prevents on damage done to you. 

How this is going to work in post format:

1. You'll write up a post covering part number 1 above.
2. I'll read your post, and *discord react* the number of dice you'll get for your post. 
3. You'll *edit your post* and add to the bottom "Attack: X, Defense: Y" where X and Y are how many of your pool you are putting into each group. 
4. I'll post with the results of your rolls and the NPCs reactions to your actions. 
  > For the sake of speed, I'm following a recommendation in Wushu's book to roll the dice for the players in a play by post environment. I'll be using the dice roller bot and you'll be able to see the rolls in the dice channel. 

5. Rinse and Repeat.

## Damage 

At the start of a fight, every player character receives 3 hit points. You aren't defeated until you can't lose anymore hit points. (Till you take damage at 0 hit points.) Every round the threat you're fighting deals *one automatic hit* to every player. If you rolled defense dice, any successes you rolled with them are used before your hit points. 

Enemies that are more than just mooks have their own hit points and rather than a single automatic hit they get to roll their own attack and defense dice. You'll be informed when a *Nemesis* appears in a scene.  

## Side Goals

Often you will do something in a turn that is unrelated to defeating the threat or objective of the action. These side goals in the scenario also have a threat number to be defeated. The only difference is that a side goal does not get an automatic hit against the players. These side goals do not have to be completed, though it's almost always in your benefit to complete them. 

## Conclusion

That's it for the rules. [Here](http://danielbayn.com/wushu/) is the full Wushu rulebook if you're so inclined to read up on the system. Following this section is what you'll need to know to make a character for Wushu. 

# Character Generation

## Aspects

Aspects are defined in the *Fate Core* book as

> Aspects are phrases that describe some significant detail about a character. They are the reasons why your character matters, why we’re interested in seeing your character in the game. Aspects can cover a wide range of elements, such as personality or descriptive traits, beliefs, relationships, issues and problems, or anything else that helps us invest in the character as a person, rather than just a collection of stats. 

Aspects are short phrases that sum up an *aspect* of your character's personality. In Wushu, almost the exact same thing is referred to as a trait. If you aren't good at witty phrases, that's okay. *Fate* has a few tips for that. 

> If you’re struggling to make an aspect, write out the idea in as many words as you need to, in order to get it down on paper in the first place. If a specific phrase pops up after you write it down, great! If not, maybe someone else at the table can help you come up with an aspect. And if you’re still stuck, leave it for now; you’ll have plenty of time during play to refine it.

Paraphrasing a longer section on aspects, the best aspects have three parts. 

1. Aspects should be **double edged**; which means it can be both a good thing and a bad thing. *Super Nerd* can mean your smart, but it can also mean you're an easy target for bullying. 
2. Aspects should **say more than one thing**; or the aspect describes more than thing about your character. *I want to prove myself* says one thing about the character, *I want to prove myself to my lawyer father* says more than one thing. 
3. Aspects should **keep it simple**; *Child blessed with Pastoral Bliss* may sound catchy, but it's harder to relate to what's going on in the game. *Son of an expert farmer* says the same thing but is far clearer. 

> Here are some guidelines for choosing aspects. Aspects which don’t help you tell a good story (by giving you success when you need it and by drawing you into danger and action when the story needs it) aren’t doing their job. The aspects which push you into conflict, and help you excel once you’re there, will be among your best and most-used. Aspects need to be both useful and dangerous; allowing you to help shape the story and generating lots of fate points and they should never be boring. The best aspect suggests both ways to use it and ways it can complicate your situation. Aspects that cannot be used for either of those are likely to be dull indeed. Bottom line: if you want to maximize the power of your aspects, maximize their interest.

In addition, you don't want your aspects to overlap. Have them define different parts of your character. Wushu provides three suggestions for aspects, covering different parts of your character. They are **Motivation, Fighting Style,** and **Profession**. Below are example of aspects from *Fate Core*. 

> * **Significant personality traits or beliefs** Sucker for a Pretty Face, Never Leave a Man Behind, The Only Good Tsyntavian Is a Dead Tsyntavian.
> * **The character’s background or profession** Educated at the Academy of Blades, Born a Spacer, Cybernetic Street Thief. 
> * **An important possession or noticeable feature** My Father’s Bloodstained Sword, Dressed to the Nines, Sharp Eyed Veteran. 
> * **Relationships to people and organizations** In League with the Twisting Hand, The King’s Favor, Proud Member of the Company of Lords. 
> * **Problems, goals, or issues the character is dealing with** A Price on My Head, The King Must Die, Fear of Heights. 
> * **Titles, reputations, or obligations the character may have** Self- Important Merchant Guildmaster, Silver-Tongued Scoundrel, Honor-Bound to Avenge My Brother.

**If you need help with aspects, I recommend crowd sourcing it to the channel.** It's hard to come up with them sometimes, in my opinion. 

### Special Aspects

The following are two special styles of traits in Wushu. If you so desire, we can discuss using them with your character. 

> **Milestone Traits** - To really get Campbellian on their asses, you should plan out a series of three milestones for any new Trait. Each time the player meets one of these challenges, or makes a milestone choice, the Trait increases by one. For example, a hero trying to master an ancient and cursed weapon might have the following milestones ahead:

> 1. Use the weapon to defeat an enemy in combat.
> 2. Use the weapon to defend an enemy from harm.
> 3. Use the weapon to prevent a fight you want to win.

> At first, using this weapon would mean rolling against the default target number of 2. After their first combat victory, the relevant Trait increases to 3. After successfully defending a hated enemy, the Trait increases to 4. Finally, after learning the true value of human life (awww), the Trait increases to 5. Only those who do not seek power are fit to wield it.

> **Two-Sided Traits** - If you want to drive home a character’s dramatic arc, consider giving them a pair of opposed Traits like Occult Power and Sanity, Honor and Freedom, or Loved and Feared. These two Traits always have 6 points between them; increasing one means decreasing the other. You could have Occult Power 4 and Sanity 2 (4+2=6), but never Occult Power 4 and Sanity 3 (4+3=7). Pushing either Trait to level 5 means turning the other into a Weakness.

> Unlike normal Traits, these are meant to be adjusted during play. Any time the player makes a choice that pushes in one direction, increase/decrease the Trait ratings accordingly. Do this before the dice are rolled, so the player is always faced with the temptation of quick power. Never let them adjust it back in the other direction right away, though. Choices mean little without consequence.

## Points assignments

You can choose any one of these you'd like to define your character. Your best bet is to list the aspects you want to define for your character *before* you assign them numbers. 

```
5 - Trait 1
4 - Trait 2
3 - Trait 3
1 - Weakness
```

```
4 - Trait 1
4 - Trait 2
4 - Trait 3
1 - Weakness
```

```
5 - Trait 1
3 - Trait 2
3 - Trait 3
3 - Trait 4
1 - Weakness
```

```
5 - Trait 1
5 - Trait 2
1 - Weakness
```

```
3 - Trait 1
3 - Trait 2
3 - Trait 3
3 - Trait 4
3 - Trait 5
3 - Trait 6
1 - Weakness
```

## Building a character:

* **Step one:**: Write up aspects for your character. Come up with a bunch, it can't hurt to explain your character more. Don't forget to give them a weakness as well.
* **Step two**: Decide what point assignment you'll be using. Stick your aspects into the template.
* **Step three**: Give your character a name. 

Your done!
