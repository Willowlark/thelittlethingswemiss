This page serves as a reference for the game's format on our discord server. With as many players as we have organization is important to keeping the game moving, which as discussed in earlier post is very important for a slow paced game like ours. It'll also make our story easier to follow and read. 

Something I want to emphasize. Much like in reality, if you don't show an interest in other people you won't get any interest your way. Take an interest in working with the other characters in the game and you'll have much more fun playing.

# The Gameplay Areas

## IC (In Character)

These channels are the primary gameplay areas. They can be compared to the table everyone would be sitting around in person. These channels, at least in the beginning, will be dedicated to the *group* events. Everyone in one of the parties will be involved in the events in these channels. There are multiple channels available because it's not expected all of you will be in a massive group all the time. Smaller parties may form and do different things at the same time, and that will branch into two different channels in this section. 

### Breakdown

A scene will start with a post looking like this:

![](https://i.imgur.com/vwWfQEQ.png)

While the NPC section may be skipped if there are no NPCs, the other sections are always going to be there to give you a reference point. That said, this block represents the **start** of the scene. If an NPC or character enters the scene later, that's not going to be reflected in the above post. 

Following the scene setting post, the GM will have an opening post for the round. To continue off the scene set above, we have this post:

![](https://i.imgur.com/hfhClrV.png)

Once the GM has started the round, each player gets to post once. (For the sake of brevity only Alice and Bob will have posts in the example.)

Alice's post is fairly standard. It describes her thoughts and and actions. Bob's is a little more complicated. When you want to ask a handful of quick questions to an NPC (The kind that have quick responses) you can put a list of questions in a *quote block* like below. (Note those are the **backtick** symbol, located on the same key as **~**.) If you only have one question, you don't have to do this whole thing. The goal is to do a few rounds of question, answer; question, answer; all at once. If you'd like to have a more in depth, personal conversation, you can start an Aside, detailed in the next section.

<pre>
```
1.
2.
```
</pre>

When the time on the round has expired, the GM will post again, responding to what everyone's doing in the scene.

In this post you can see the response to Bob's questions are numbered. However rather than dig into more conversation, some action is afoot! Alice and Bob could certainly leave Larry to his fate, but what self respecting hero would do that? (We're skipping Bob too now, because we're trying to keep the example short.)

### Conflict

Well Alice's actions certainly didn't make her any fans. The third round has started a *conflict* which needs to be resolved (which is started by the third post above). The **entire conflict** has a score of 6. Any action taken to resolving the conflict that succeeds will reduce this number. This doesn't mean you have to knock out 6 ruffians. Be creative! 

![](https://i.imgur.com/sFzoJ6y.png)

Alice is decidedly not creative. Take note here, as the GM it was never said the door was left open. If you need a detail to add to how you made your action, add it! As long as it doesn't conflict with something someone else said that's okay. Now not pictured, the GM will react to your post with a number. This number will be up to the *dice pool* number on the conflict and is awarded based on the details in your post. The more dice you have, the more dice you dedicate to either trying to reduce the threat number or protect yourself.

When you try to reduce the threat number, the GM will decide what the most relevant trait you have to the action you're doing is. The GM will roll as many dice as you dedicated to reducing it and for every die that comes up **under** your trait **number** you reduce the threat by one. 

When you protect yourself, you use the **same** trait as the one used with reducing rolls. For every die rolled under the trait number you prevent one hit against you. There is **one automatic hit** against you by the threat itself every round. If there's an enemy character that's rolling dice, they can score hits against you the same way you can against them. You have three hit points (though you aren't out till you hit negative!). Those hit points reset every encounter.

For the above example, The GM awards Alice 3 dice. Alice's player adds the bottom of the post `Attack: 2, Defense: 1`. The GM, before the next round, will roll the dice in the dice channel for Alice's attacks and defense against her most relevant trait. If Alice doesn't roll for her one defense, she gets hit once. For every hit she gets on her attacks, she reduces the threat number. At this point the rounds loop until the threat or players have no level/hp left. The winner gets to narrate their victory and regular rounds resume. 

## Asides

The asides channels both don't follow the same 'mechanical' rules as the IC channels and don't follow a group by default. If you decide your character would like to have a conversation with another character in the party privately, the asides are the place to do it. Same goes if you'd like to grill an npc you met. An aside is characterized by a conversation out of the usual game flow. The reason I'm adding these is two fold, the first of which means the group IC channel won't have all of these messages in it. The second is that this allows you to *ignore the usual post waiting time*. 

A conversation is a back and forth, often rapid exchange. If you have to wait 48 hours for your next response, it'll take a week to get through 'hi, how are you, good and you?'. The asides working without a posting time is so that you can get into what you want to say in character. Conversations, in many cases, are also quick affairs where the scene doesn't change. By this I mean if Bob and Alice step away from the rest of the party and discuss if they believe the shopkeeper is lying to them, when they finish the scene is still in the store, everyone hasn't really moved, and the story can pick up where it left off. Asides are **not** for things that change the scene, moving your characters away from what they're taking an aside from. They should not be used for a 'multipart' scene either; the aside should happen and then end.

### Do's and Don'ts

* Do have an aside when you want to converse with another character in the scene at length.
* Don't have an aside when you want to ditch the group for awhile. (This is splitting the party, you'd likely end up on a second IC channel.)
* Do have an aside when you want to add a bit to a time skip such as 'you travel the rest of the day and eventually make camp'. (you could have a conversation on the trail, in camp, etc.)
* Don't try to advance the IC channel's events from the aside. You may have decided to steal from Bob in your aside, but you have to *do* the stealing in the IC channel.
* Do message the GM if you need dice rolled for anything. 
* Don't have your aside somewhere completely unrelated to the IC channel you asided from. (You were in a general store, your aside shouldn't take place in the woods.)
* Do your asides quickly, the faster they're done the faster the channel can be used for a new one.

### Breakdown

The ideal way to start is to contact the other party out of character and setup a time you both can have the aside. (You are not obligated to do a suggested aside.) Let the GM know which channel you'll be taking, sign on together, and type away! If you find it's going longer than you expected that's okay, just be proactive about finishing the aside sooner rather than later. (Orphaned asides can and will be ended prematurely.) This is the same for both NPCs and other players. 

Formatting wise, there should be an opening post which can be pinned to the top of the channel looking like the below. Fill in your information and post that before you start. This should be reminiscent of the way scene's change in the IC channels.

```
Location: <location>
Coming from: <the location you were at before you asided>
Characters: <list of characters>
```

# Conclusion

If you have any questions, refer to either the Wushu rulebook or post a question to the out of character channel. It will take some time to get used to, but I hope this gives you an idea of how we play the game.
