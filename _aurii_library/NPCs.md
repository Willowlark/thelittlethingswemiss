Aria is often torn between love and the duty of the Fauns. 
The latter usually wins.

Aria loved her grandfather (laguz) very much and gets her sense of duty from him.

Aria loves Jorand for the same reason Yuria loves Cyn. Jorand sees only her, not her outward appearance. 

Jorand outranks Aria by a rank, but at home Aria calls the shots.
