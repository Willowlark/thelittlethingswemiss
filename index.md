# Welcome

You've reached the landing page of The Little Things We Miss. Featured on this site is the work by Bill Clark (that's me!), a hobbyist photographer who dabbles in a little bit of everything. 

* **Pinned**: Highlighted blog posts for easy reference.
* **Blog**: Individual articles about photography, cosplay, or both.
* **Group**: Photo galleries from Group photoshoots at conventions. Specifically anyone from the same series gets up front and strikes a pose.
* **Personal**: A poor name for them, but shoots in which I'm working one on one with the model (Lets be honest, cosplayer) and have a lot more time and freedom to make fantastic photography.
