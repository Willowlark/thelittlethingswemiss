# Welcome

You've reached the landing page of The Little Things We Miss. Featured on this site is the work by Bill Clark (that's me!), a hobbyist photographer who dabbles in a little bit of everything. Links to my social media accounts are located in the top left, feel free to follow for notification of updates. 

* **Blog**: Individual articles about photography, cosplay, or both.
> *Definitely Check out the [Eccentric Tip Jar]({{site.baseurl}}/blog/2017/07/22/shoot-faq.html#the-eccentric-tip-jar), where I list every interesting thing I've been tipped with.* 
* **The Little Things** My namesake series of photography.
* **Gatherings**: Photo galleries from Gathering photoshoots at conventions. Specifically anyone from the same series gets up front and strikes a pose.
* **Personal**: A poor name for them, but shoots in which I'm working one on one with the model(s) and spend time with them.
